abstract = {Wildfire is a worldwide phenomenon that is expected to increase in extent and severity in the future, due to fuel accumulations, shifting land management practices, and climate change. It immediately affects the landscape by removing vegetation, depositing ash, influencing water-repellent soil formation, and physically weathering boulders and bedrock. These changes typically lead to increased erosion through sheetwash, rilling, dry ravel, and increased mass movement in the form of floods, debris flow, rockfall, and landslides. These process changes bring about landform changes as hillslopes are lowered and stream channels aggrade or incise at increased rates. Furthermore, development of alluvial fans, debris fans, and talus cones are enhanced. The window of disturbance to the landscape caused by wildfire is typically on the order of 3–4years, with some effects persisting up to 30years.}

The model was designed and implemented using spatial multi-criteria evaluation techniques in a GIS system. Each indicator was processed, analysed and standardised according to its contribution to hazard and vulnerability. The indicators were weighted using direct, pairwise comparison and rank-ordering weighting methods, and weights were combined to obtain the final landslide risk index map. The results were analysed per physiographic region and administrative units at provincial and municipal levels. The Sierra Maestra mountain system was found to have the largest concentration of high landslide risk index values while the Nipe\textendash Cristal\textendash Baracoa system has the highest absolute values, although they are more dispersed. The results obtained allow designing an appropriated landslide risk mitigation plan at national level and to link the information to the national hurricane early warning system, allowing also warning and evacuation for landslide-prone areas.},

Over ocean, products are compared to frequency of precipitation from ship observations.

Extreme precipitation events are of particular importance because of their severe impact on the economy, the environment, and the society. In recent years, the emergence of various satellite-retrieved precipitation products with high spatial resolutions and global coverage have resulted in new sources of uninterrupted precipitation estimates. However, satellite-based estimates are not well integrated into operational and decision-making applications because of a lack of information regarding the associated uncertainties and reliability of these products. In this study, four satellite-derived precipitation products (CMORPH, PERSIANN, TMPA-RT, and TMPA-V6) are evaluated with respect to their performance in capturing precipitation extremes. The Stage IV (radar-based, gauge-adjusted) precipitation estimates are used as reference data. The results show that with respect to the probability of detecting extremes and the volume of correctly identified precipitation, CMORPH and PERSIANN data sets lead to better estimates. However, their false alarm ratio and volume are higher than those of TMPA-RT and TMPA-V6. Overall, no single precipitation product can be considered ideal for detecting extreme events. In fact, all precipitation products tend to miss a significant volume of rainfall. With respect to verification metrics used in this study, the performance of all satellite products tended to worsen as the choice of extreme precipitation threshold increased. The analyses suggest that extensive efforts are necessary to develop algorithms that can capture extremes more reliably.},

Airborne and spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) instruments transmit microwaves toward Earth's surface and detect the returning reflected waves. The phase of the returned wave depends on the distance between the satellite and the surface, but it is also altered by atmospheric and other effects. InSAR provides measurements of surface deformation by combining amplitude and phase information from two SAR images of the same location taken at different times to create an interferogram. Several existing open-source analysis tools [Rosen et al., 2004; Rosen et al., 2011; Kampes et al., 2003; Sandwell et al., 2011] enable scientists to exploit observations from radar satellites acquired at two different epochs to produce a surface displacement map.},

  abstract = {Hydrologic modeling is one of the primary tools utilized for drought monitoring and drought early warning systems. Several sources of uncertainty in hydrologic modeling have been addressed in the literature. However, few studies have assessed the uncertainty of gridded observation datasets from a drought monitoring perspective. This study provides a hydrologic modeling oriented analysis of the gridded observation data uncertainties over the Pacific Northwest (PNW) and its implications on drought assessment. We utilized a recently developed 100-member ensemble-based observed forcing data to simulate hydrologic fluxes at 1/8\textdegree{} spatial resolution using Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model, and compared the results with a deterministic observation. Meteorological and hydrological droughts are studied at multiple timescales over the basin, and seasonal long-term trends and variations of drought extent is investigated for each case. Results reveal large uncertainty of observed datasets at monthly timescale, with systematic differences for temperature records, mainly due to different lapse rates. The uncertainty eventuates in large disparities of drought characteristics. In general, an increasing trend is found for winter drought extent across the PNW. Furthermore, a {$\sim$}3\% decrease per decade is detected for snow water equivalent (SWE) over the PNW, with the region being more susceptible to SWE variations of the northern Rockies than the western Cascades. The agricultural areas of southern Idaho demonstrate decreasing trend of natural soil moisture as a result of precipitation decline, which implies higher appeal for anthropogenic water storage and irrigation systems.},

  abstract = {In this study, landslide risk assessment for Izmir city (west Turkey) was carried out, and the environmental effects of landslides on further urban development were evaluated using geographical information systems and remote sensing techniques. For this purpose, two different data groups, namely conditioning and triggering data, were produced. With the help of conditioning data such as lithology, slope gradient, slope aspect, distance from roads, distance from faults and distance from drainage lines, a landslide susceptibility model was constructed by using logistic regression modelling approach. The accuracy assessment of the susceptibility map was carried out by the area under curvature (AUC) approach, and a 0.810 AUC value was obtained. This value shows that the map obtained is successful. Due to the fact that the study area is located in an active seismic region, earthquake data were considered as primary triggering factor contributing to landslide occurrence. In addition to this, precipitation data were also taken into account as a secondary triggering factor. Considering the susceptibility data and triggering factors, a landslide hazard index was obtained. Furthermore, using the Aster data, a land-cover map was produced with an overall kappa value of 0.94. From this map, settlement areas were extracted, and these extracted data were assessed as elements at risk in the study area. Next, a vulnerability index was created by using these data. Finally, the hazard index and the vulnerability index were combined, and a landslide risk map for Izmir city was obtained. Based on this final risk map, it was observed that especially south and north parts of the Izmir Bay, where urbanization is dense, are threatened to future landsliding. This result can be used for preliminary land use planning by local governmental authorities.},

Landslide susceptibility maps were produced using each of the three methods and then compared and validated. Before the modeling and validation, the observed landslides were separated into two groups. The first group was for training, and the other group was for validation steps. The accuracy of models was measured by fitting them to a validation set of observed landslides. For validation process, the area under curvature (AUC) approach was applied. According to the AUC values of 0.810, 0.764, and 0.710 for logistic regression, likelihood ratio, and multi-criteria decision analysis, respectively, logistic regression was determined to be the most accurate method among the other used landslide susceptibility mapping methods. Based on these results, logistic regression and likelihood ratio models can be used to mitigate hazards related to landslides and to aid in land-use planning.},

A landslide inventory dataset including 351 landslide locations was obtained for the study area. After completing the data production stage of the study, the data were processed using a soft computing approach, i.e., a Mamdani-type fuzzy inference system. In this system, only landslide conditioning data were assessed, and landslide inventory data were not included in the assessment approach. Thus, a file depicting the landslide susceptibility degrees for the study area was produced using the Mamdani FIS. These degrees were then exported into a GIS environment, and a landslide susceptibility map was produced and assessed in point of statistical interpretation. For this purpose, the obtained landslide susceptibility map and the landslide inventory data were compared, and an area under curve (AUC) obtained from receiver operating characteristics (ROC) assessment was carried out. From this assessment, the AUC value was found to be 0.855, indicating that this landslide susceptibility map, which was produced in a data-independent manner, was successful.},

Landslide inventory of the area was made by detailed field surveys and the analyses of the topographical map. The landslide triggering factors are considered to be slope angle, slope aspect, distance from drainage, distance from roads and the weathered lithological units, which were called as ``geotechnical units'' in the study. Idrisi and ArcGIS packages manipulated all the collected data. Logistic regression (LR) and weighted linear combination (WLC) statistical methods were used to create a landslide susceptibility map for the study area. The results were assessed within the scope of two different points: (a) effectiveness of the methods used and (b) effectiveness of the environmental casual parameters influencing the landslides. The results showed that the WLC model is more suitable than the LR model. Regarding the casual parameters, geotechnical units and slopes were found to be the most important variables for estimating the landslide susceptibility in the study area.},

  abstract = {Landslides are very common natural problems in the Black Sea Region of Turkey due to the steep topography, improper use of land cover and adverse climatic conditions for landslides. In the western part of region, many studies have been carried out especially in the last decade for landslide susceptibility mapping using different evaluation methods such as deterministic approach, landslide distribution, qualitative, statistical and distribution-free analyses. The purpose of this study is to produce landslide susceptibility maps of a landslide-prone area (Findikli district, Rize) located at the eastern part of the Black Sea Region of Turkey by likelihood frequency ratio (LRM) model and weighted linear combination (WLC) model and to compare the results obtained. For this purpose, landslide inventory map of the area were prepared for the years of 1983 and 1995 by detailed field surveys and aerial-photography studies. Slope angle, slope aspect, lithology, distance from drainage lines, distance from roads and the land-cover of the study area are considered as the landslide-conditioning parameters. The differences between the susceptibility maps derived by the LRM and the WLC models are relatively minor when broad-based classifications are taken into account. However, the WLC map showed more details but the other map produced by LRM model produced weak results. The reason for this result is considered to be the fact that the majority of pixels in the LRM map have high values than the WLC-derived susceptibility map. In order to validate the two susceptibility maps, both of them were compared with the landslide inventory map. Although the landslides do not exist in the very high susceptibility class of the both maps, 79\% of the landslides fall into the high and very high susceptibility zones of the WLC map while this is 49\% for the LRM map. This shows that the WLC model exhibited higher performance than the LRM model.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the results of geographical information system (GIS)-based landslide susceptibility mapping in Ayval\i k, western Turkey using multi-criteria decision analysis. The methodology followed in the study includes data production, standardization, and analysis stages. A landslide inventory of the study area was compiled from aerial photographs, satellite image interpretations, and detailed field surveys. In total, 45 landslides were recorded and mapped. The areal extent of the landslides is 1.75 km2. The identified landslides are mostly shallow-seated, and generally exhibit progressive character. They are mainly classified as rotational, planar, and toppling failures. In all, 51, 45, and 4\% of the landslides mapped are rotational, planar, and toppling types, respectively. Morphological, geological, and land-use data were produced using existing topographical and relevant thematic maps in a GIS framework. The considered landslide-conditioning parameters were slope gradient, slope aspect, lithology, weathering state of the rocks, stream power index, topographical wetness index, distance from drainage, lineament density, and land-cover and vegetation density. These landslide parameters were standardized in a common data scale by fuzzy membership functions. Then, the degree to which each parameter contributed to landslides was determined using the analytical hierarchy process method, and the weight values of these parameters were calculated. The weight values obtained were assigned to the corresponding parameters, and then the weighted parameters were combined to produce a landslide susceptibility map. The results obtained from the susceptibility map were evaluated with the landslide location data to assess the reliability of the map. Based on the findings obtained in this study, it was found that 5.19\% of the total area was prone to landsliding due to the existence of highly and completely weathered lithologic units and due to the adverse effects of topography and improper land use.},

The First Edition was widely praised for its readability, and that emphasis is retained. The second edition opens with a new introductory chapter that sets the stage for what follows. The treatment of geomorphology and hydrology are greatly expanded from the first edition, and have been split into two, more substantial chapters. Basal energy resources, trophic roles and food web interactions are retained but thoroughly updated, particularly to include recent advances in microbial ecology and the synergies between producers and decomposers. The discussion of species interactions has been re-organized so that modern topics receive more emphasis, including trophic cascades, subsidies and food web structure. Chapters on organic matter dynamics and nutrient cycling have been substantially re-written to reflect the enormous growth in knowledge of stream metabolism and nutrient processes, the core of ecosystem functioning. The closing chapter on human impacts summarizes the status of river ecosystems and principal threats, and new material that describes advances in river management including the science of environmental flows, the successes and failures of river restoration, and the potential for ecosystem-based catchment management.},

These instantaneous rainfall rate fields [i.e., 1)-3)] can be considered as radar products with the largest coverage currently available from space- and ground-based radar observations. Although accumulated rainfall amounts are often similar, we find the PR and Q2 rain-rate histograms quite different. PR rain-rate histograms are shifted toward lower rain rates, implying a much larger stratiform/convective rain ratio than do products such as Q2. The shift is more evident during strong continental convective storms and not as pronounced in tropical rain. A ``continental/maritime regime'' behavior is also observed upon adjusting the Q2 products to rain gauges, yet the rain amount more closely agrees with that of PR. The independent PR/ARMOR comparisons confirm this systematic regime behavior. In addition, comparisons are performed over central Florida where PR, Q2, and the NASA TRMM ground validation products are available. These comparisons show large discrepancies among all three products. Resolving the large discrepancies between the products presents an important set of challenges related to improving remote-sensing estimates of precipitation in general and during extreme events in particular.},

  abstract = {Topographic surveys inevitably contain error, introducing uncertainty into estimates of volumetric or mean change based on the differencing of repeated surveys. In the geomorphic community, uncertainty has often been framed as a problem of separating out real change from apparent change due purely to error, and addressed by removing measured change considered indistinguishable from random noise from analyses (thresholding). Thresholding is important when quantifying gross changes (i.e. total erosion or total deposition), which are systematically biased by random errors in stable parts of a landscape. However, net change estimates are not substantially influenced by those same random errors, and the use of thresholds results in inherently biased, and potentially misleading, estimates of net change and uncertainty. More generally, thresholding is unrelated to the important process of propagating uncertainty in order to place uncertainty bounds around final estimates. Error propagation methods for uncorrelated, correlated, and systematic errors are presented. Those equations demonstrate that uncertainties in modern net change analyses, as well as in gross change analyses using reasonable thresholds, are likely to be dominated by low-magnitude but highly correlated or systematic errors, even after careful attempts to reduce those errors. In contrast, random errors with little to no correlation largely cancel to negligible levels when averaged or summed. Propagated uncertainty is then typically insensitive to the precision of individual measurements, and is instead defined by the relative mean error (accuracy) over the area of interest. Given that real-world mean elevation changes in many landscape settings are often similar in magnitude to potential mean errors in repeat topographic analyses, reducing highly correlated or systematic errors will be central to obtaining accurate change estimates, while placing uncertainty bounds around those results provides essential context for their interpretation.

Here, the spatial dependence or spatial correlation in the residuals from the fitted regression model was accounted for by inserting an autocovariate into the model. The autocovariate was estimated by applying a Gibbs sampler to the susceptibilities for neighbouring pixels. As in any landslide susceptibility analysis, accuracy was difficult to assess because of the requirement for data on future landslides. However, by comparing the ordinary logistic model to the autologistic model obtained on the same set of data, it was possible to assess the influence of the autocovariate. The autocovariate rendered the model simpler because several variables lost their significance and were, therefore, omitted from the model. Further, areas of high landslide susceptibility estimated from the autologistic model were geographically clustered, as one would expect, and this may be advantageous in terms of (i) interpreting the model and (ii) displaying the results to non-experts.},

The landslides in the region were then classified into dormant and active types and further linear models were obtained for each. While geology and slope angle were again the most significant factors in each model, slope aspect and strike were less significant for active landslides. Finally, further independent variables applicable to active landslides only (vegetation cover, soil thickness, horizontal curvature, vertical curvature, concavity of slope, local relief and roughness) were added to the model for active landslides. Interestingly, with these new variables added, vegetation cover and concavity of slope were found to be more significant than geology and slope angle.},

Landslide hazard areas were analysed and mapped, using the landslide-occurrence factors, by the probability\textendash likelihood ratio method. The results of the analysis were verified using actual landslide location data. The validation results showed satisfactory agreement between the hazard map and the existing data on landslide locations.},

  abstract = {As a first step forward in regional hazard management, multivariate statistical analysis in the form of logistic regression was used to produce a landslide susceptibility map in the Kakuda-Yahiko Mountains of Central Japan. There are different methods to prepare landslide susceptibility maps. The use of logistic regression in this study stemmed not only from the fact that this approach relaxes the strict assumptions required by other multivariate statistical methods, but also to demonstrate that it can be combined with bivariate statistical analyses (BSA) to simplify the interpretation of the model obtained at the end. In susceptibility mapping, the use of logistic regression is to find the best fitting function to describe the relationship between the presence or absence of landslides (dependent variable) and a set of independent parameters such as slope angle and lithology. Here, an inventory map of 87 landslides was used to produce a dependent variable, which takes a value of 0 for the absence and 1 for the presence of slope failures. Lithology, bed rock-slope relationship, lineaments, slope gradient, aspect, elevation and road network were taken as independent parameters. The effect of each parameter on landslide occurrence was assessed from the corresponding coefficient that appears in the logistic regression function. The interpretations of the coefficients showed that road network plays a major role in determining landslide occurrence and distribution. Among the geomorphological parameters, aspect and slope gradient have a more significant contribution than elevation, although field observations showed that the latter is a good estimator of the approximate location of slope cuts. Using a predicted map of probability, the study area was classified into five categories of landslide susceptibility: extremely low, very low, low, medium and high. The medium and high susceptibility zones make up 8.87\% of the total study area and involve mid-altitude slopes in the eastern part of Kakuda Mountain and the central and southern parts of Yahiko Mountain.},

In this study, we presented an approach for the analysis and modeling of landslide data using rare events logistic regression and applied the approach to an area in Lianyungang, China. Digital orthophotomaps, digital elevation models of the region, geological maps and different GIS layers including settlement, road net and rivers were collected and applied in the analysis. Landslides were identified by monoscopic manual interpretation and validated during the field investigation. To validate the quality of mapping, the data from the study area were divided into a training set and validation set. The result map showed that 4.26\% of the study area was identified as having very high susceptibility to landslides, whereas the others were classified as having very low susceptibility (47.2\%), low susceptibility (22.21\%), medium susceptibility (14.39\%) and high susceptibility (11.93\%). The quality of the landslide-susceptibility map produced in this paper was validated, and it can be used for planning protective and mitigation measures. The landslide-susceptibility map is a fundamental part of the Lianyungang city landslide risk assessment.},

Minimum power pool levels in both Lake Mead and Lake Powell will be reached under current conditions by 2017 with 50\% probability.

  abstract = {The state of knowledge and resources available to issue alerts of precipitation-induced landslides vary across the USA. Federal and state agencies currently issue warnings of the potential for shallow, rapidly moving landslides and debris flows in a few areas along the Pacific coast and for areas affected by Atlantic hurricanes. However, these agencies generally lack resources needed to provide continuous support or to expand services to other areas. Precipitation thresholds that form the basis of landslide warning systems now exist for a few areas of the USA, but the threshold rainfall amounts and durations vary over three orders of magnitude nationwide and over an order of magnitude across small geographic areas such as a county. Antecedent moisture conditions also have a significant effect, particularly in areas that have distinct wet and dry seasons. Early warnings of shallow landslides that include specific information about affected areas, probability of landslide occurrence, and expected timing are technically feasible as illustrated by a case study from the Seattle, WA area. The four-level warning scheme (Null, Outlook, Watch, Warning) defined for Seattle is based on observed or predicted exceedance of a cumulative precipitation threshold and a rainfall intensity\textendash duration threshold combined with real-time monitoring of soil moisture. Based on analysis of historical data, threshold performance varies according to precipitation characteristics, and threshold exceedance corresponds to a given probability of landslide occurrence. Experience in Seattle during December 2004 and January 2005 illustrates some of the challenges of providing landslide early warning on the USA West Coast.},

  abstract = {Shallow rainfall-induced landslides commonly occur under conditions of transient infiltration into initially unsaturated soils. In an effort to predict the timing and location of such landslides, we developed a model of the infiltration process using a two-layer system that consists of an unsaturated zone above a saturated zone and implemented this model in a geographic information system (GIS) framework. The model links analytical solutions for transient, unsaturated, vertical infiltration above the water table to pressure-diffusion solutions for pressure changes below the water table. The solutions are coupled through a transient water table that rises as water accumulates at the base of the unsaturated zone. This scheme, though limited to simplified soil-water characteristics and moist initial conditions, greatly improves computational efficiency over numerical models in spatially distributed modeling applications. Pore pressures computed by these coupled models are subsequently used in one-dimensional slope-stability computations to estimate the timing and locations of slope failures. Applied over a digital landscape near Seattle, Washington, for an hourly rainfall history known to trigger shallow landslides, the model computes a factor of safety for each grid cell at any time during a rainstorm. The unsaturated layer attenuates and delays the rainfall-induced pore-pressure response of the model at depth, consistent with observations at an instrumented hillside near Edmonds, Washington. This attenuation results in realistic estimates of timing for the onset of slope instability (7 h earlier than observed landslides, on average). By considering the spatial distribution of physical properties, the model predicts the primary source areas of landslides.},

Shallow earth slides triggered by heavy rainfall are the most common type of landslide in the area; many transform into debris flows and cause significant property damage or disrupt transportation. Large rotational and translational slides, though less common, also cause serious property damage. The hundreds of landslides that occurred during the winters of 1995\textendash 96 and 1996\textendash 97 stimulated renewed interest by Puget Sound communities in identifying landslide-prone areas and taking actions to reduce future landslide losses. Informal partnerships between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the City of Seattle, and private consultants are focusing on the problem of identifying and mapping areas of landslide hazard as well as characterizing temporal aspects of the hazard. We have developed GIS-based methods to map the probability of landslide occurrence as well as empirical rainfall thresholds and physically based methods to forecast times of landslide occurrence. Our methods for mapping landslide hazard zones began with field studies and physically based models to assess relative slope stability, including the effects of material properties, seasonal groundwater levels, and rainfall infiltration. We have analyzed the correlation between historic landslide occurrence and relative slope stability to map the degree of landslide hazard. The City of Seattle is using results of the USGS studies in storm preparedness planning for emergency access and response, planning for development or redevelopment of hillsides, and municipal facility planning and prioritization. Methods we have developed could be applied elsewhere to suit local needs and available data.},

  abstract = {Current global precipitation (P) datasets do not take full advantage of the complementary nature of satellite and reanalysis data. Here, we present Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP) version 1.1, a global P dataset for the period 1979-2015 with a 3hourly temporal and 0.25 degrees ffi spatial resolution, specifically designed for hydrological modeling. The design philosophy of MSWEP was to optimally merge the highest quality P data sources available as a function of timescale and location. The long-term mean of MSWEP was based on the CHPclim dataset but replaced with more accurate regional datasets where available. A correction for gauge under-catch and orographic effects was introduced by inferring catchment-average P from streamflow (Q) observations at 13 762 stations across the globe. The temporal variability of MSWEP was determined by weighted averaging of P anomalies from seven datasets; two based solely on interpolation of gauge observations (CPC Unified and GPCC), three on satellite remote sensing (CMORPH, GSMaP-MVK, and TMPA 3B42RT), and two on atmospheric model reanalysis (ERA-Interim and JRA-55). For each grid cell, the weight assigned to the gauge-based estimates was calculated from the gauge network density, while the weights assigned to the satellite-and reanalysis-based estimates were calculated from their comparative performance at the surrounding gauges. The quality of MSWEP was compared against four state-of-the-art gauge-adjusted P datasets (WFDEI-CRU, GPCP-1DD, TMPA 3B42, and CPC Unified) using independent P data from 125 FLUXNET tower stations around the globe. MSWEP obtained the highest daily correlation coefficient (R) among the five P datasets for 60.0\% of the stations and a median R of 0.67 vs. 0.44-0.59 for the other datasets. We further evaluated the performance of MSWEP using hydrological modeling for 9011 catchments ({$<$} 50 000 km(2)) across the globe. Specifically, we calibrated the simple conceptual hydrological model HBV (Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning) against daily Q observations with P from each of the different datasets. For the 1058 sparsely gauged catchments, representative of 83.9\% of the global land surface (excluding Antarctica), MSWEP obtained a median calibration NSE of 0.52 vs. 0.29-0.39 for the other P datasets. MSWEP is available via http://www.gloh2o.org.},

The present-day map is derived from an ensemble of four high-resolution, topographically-corrected climatic maps. The future map is derived from an ensemble of 32 climate model projections (scenario RCP8.5), by superimposing the projected climate change anomaly on the baseline high-resolution climatic maps. For both time periods we calculate confidence levels from the ensemble spread, providing valuable indications of the reliability of the classifications. The new maps exhibit a higher classification accuracy and substantially more detail than previous maps, particularly in regions with sharp spatial or elevation gradients. We anticipate the new maps will be useful for numerous applications, including species and vegetation distribution modeling. The new maps including the associated confidence maps are freely available via www.gloh2o.org/koppen.},

A total of 10 landslide occurrence factors that were selected including topographic slope, topographic aspect, topographic curvature and distance from drainage; lithology and distance from lineament; land cover from TM satellite images; the vegetation index value from Landsat satellite images; precipitation data. These factors were analyzed using an advanced artificial neural network model to generate the landslide hazard map. Each factor's weight was determined by the back-propagation training method. Then the landslide hazard indices were calculated using the trained back-propagation weights, and finally the landslide hazard map was generated using GIS tools. Landslide locations were used to verify results of the landslide hazard map and the verification results showed 82.92\% accuracy. The verification results showed sufficient agreement between the presumptive hazard map and the existing data on landslide areas.},

This paper compares landslide susceptibility maps obtained with the same methodology but using different landslide inventories: the official Italian landslide inventory GeoIFFI for the Lombardy Region and a recently mapped inventory (DF2001). The analysis included four main steps: (i) preparation of debris flow inventories using both random and spatial partitions and factor maps as explanatory variables; (ii) calculation of accountability and reliability indices for a preliminary susceptibility analysis and selection of an appropriate combination of the factor maps for detailed analysis; (iii) evaluation and validation of the obtained susceptibility maps; and (iv) comparison of the results and selection of the final map. The study area is located in the Valtellina Valley in the Central Italian Alps. The analysis identified highly susceptible areas of shallow landslides that may generate debris flows. It was demonstrated that more precisely delimited source areas for landslide-induced debris flows produce better susceptibility maps. However, the improvement of these maps was relatively limited when the inventories were randomly subdivided. Higher improvements were observed after the subdivision of the inventories into three geographical parts with different geomorphological characteristics. Although the modelling showed very similar results if evaluation is made using standard techniques, the spatial pattern of the susceptibility maps was highly variable and dependent on the combination of the factor maps used.},

  abstract = {Rainfall-triggered landslides are among the most widespread hazards in the world. The hydrology in and around a landslide area is key to pore pressure buildup in the soil skeleton which reduces shear strength due to the buoyancy force exerted by water in a saturated soil and to soil suction in an unsaturated soil. Extraordinary precipitation events trigger most of the landslides, but, at the same time, the vast majority of slopes do not fail. The intriguing question is: `When and where exactly can a slope become triggered to slide and flow downwards?' The objective of this article is to present and discuss landslide hydrology at three scales\textemdash pore, hillslope, and catchment\textemdash which, taken together, give an overview of this interdisciplinary science. We argue that `filling, storing, and draining' of water are all equally relevant to understand and to quantify landslide behavior. Furthermore, by addressing landslide hydrology from both earth sciences and soil mechanics perspectives, we aim to manifest the hydrological processes in hillslopes and their influence on behavior and triggering of landslides and vice versa. The challenge of landslide hydrological research is matching, at hillslope scale, causal hydrological processes with detailed physics of triggering mechanisms. At the same time, mass movements initiate changes in the hydraulic character of the soil which are important for better understanding short- and long-term hydrogeomorphic responses of soil and hillslope. Interdisciplinarity is key in advancing our knowledge on water flows in (un)stable slopes.

In this paper, part of the results of a joint research between the National Research Council (Italy) and the Disaster Prevention Research Institute of Kyoto University (Japan) are presented. The activity has focused on the mechanical characterization of the volcanoclastic material forming the Sciara del Fuoco depression and the interpretation of landslide mechanisms on the basis of large-scale ring shear tests. Attention is given here to the initiation and propagation of the submarine landslide which caused the first tsunami. In order to investigate the material response to different displacement rates in terms of shear resistance, pore pressure generation and grain crushing, ring shear tests were conducted in both undrained and drained conditions. Experimental results indicate that a fully or partial liquefaction mechanism can be invoked to explain the failure of the submarine flank of the Sciara del Fuoco and the long run-out which followed, as it was suggested by comparing pre- and post-failure in situ observations.},

  abstract = {A unique combination of airborne and ground-based Doppler radar observations, stretching continuously from the Alps south to the Mediterranean Sea, is assembled to document profoundly blocked airflow and associated modification of precipitation processes upstream of the Alps during Intensive Observing Period 8 of the Mesoscale Alpine Programme. This diversion of incident southerly low-level winds in advance of a deep baroclinic trough served to reduce markedly the transport of warm, moist Mediterranean air toward the steep Alpine slopes. Heavy rains forecast in this flood-prone region thus failed to materialize, with lighter (though protracted) stratiform precipitation extending over the comparatively flat reaches of the adjacent Po Valley. Release of convective instability did occur, but was displaced well south of the Alps over the coastal Apennine mountain chain and adjacent waters of the Mediterranean Sea. Influences on a variety of scales that evidently led to development of this blocked flow are examined, and multiple expressions of upstream blocking are identified. These range from pervasive down-valley flows observed within multiple deep Alpine river drainages to a larger-scale cool easterly low-level flow channelled alongside the curving south face of the Alps, which was ultimately extruded southward over the Mediterranean. Observed thermodynamic profiles in these contrasting regimes are presented and related to the observed precipitation structure. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2003 Royal Meteorological Society.},

However, a global review of these studies to synthesise and compare the results does not exist. There are currently no guidelines for the selection of covariates to be used in logistic regression analysis, and as such, the covariates selected vary widely between studies. An inventory of significant covariates associated with landsliding produced from the full set of such studies globally would be a useful aid to the selection of covariates in future logistic regression studies. Thus, studies using logistic regression for landslide susceptibility estimation published in the literature were collated, and a database was created of the significant factors affecting the generation of landslides. The database records the paper the data were taken from, the year of publication, the approximate longitude and latitude of the study area, the trigger method (where appropriate) and the most dominant type of landslides occurring in the study area. The significant and non-significant (at the 95~\% confidence level) covariates were recorded, as well as their coefficient, statistical significance and unit of measurement. The most common statistically significant covariate used in landslide logistic regression was slope, followed by aspect. The significant covariates related to landsliding varied for earthquake-induced landslides compared to rainfall-induced landslides, and between landslide type. More importantly, the full range of covariates used was identified along with their frequencies of inclusion. The analysis showed that there needs to be more clarity and consistency in the methodology for selecting covariates for logistic regression analysis and in the metrics included when presenting the results. Several recommendations for future studies were given.},

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) methods have the potential to overcome variability in weather conditions, which often causes delays of days or weeks when mapping landslides using optical satellite imagery. Here we test landslide classifiers based on SAR coherence, which is estimated from the similarity in phase change in time between small ensembles of pixels. We test two existing SAR-coherence-based landslide classifiers against an independent inventory of landslides triggered following the Mw 7.8 Gorkha, Nepal earthquake, and present and test a new method, which uses a classifier based on coherence calculated from ensembles of neighbouring pixels and coherence calculated from a more dispersed ensemble of \&lsquo;sibling\&rsquo; pixels. Using Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis, we show that none of these three SAR-coherence-based landslide classification methods are suitable for mapping individual landslides on a pixel-by-pixel basis. However, they show potential in generating lower-resolution density maps, which are used by emergency responders following an earthquake to coordinate large-scale operations and identify priority areas. The new method we present outperforms existing methods when tested at these lower resolutions, suggesting that it may be able to provide useful and rapid information on landslide distributions following major continental earthquakes.},

  abstract = {Particularly in mountain environments, rainfall can be extremely variable in space and time. For many hydrological applications such as modelling, extrapolation of point rainfall measurements is necessary. Decisions about the techniques used for extrapolation, as well as the adequacy of the conclusions drawn from the final results, depend heavily on the magnitude and the nature of the uncertainty involved. In this paper, we examine rainfall data from 14 rain gauges in the western mountain range of the Ecuadorian Andes. The rain gauges are located in the western part of the rio Paute basin. This area, between 3500 and 4100m asl, consists of mountainous grasslands, locally called p\'aramo, and acts as major water source for the inter-Andean valley. Spatial and temporal rainfall patterns were studied. A clear intraday pattern can be distinguished. Seasonal variation, on the other hand, is low, with a difference of about 100mm between the dryest and the wettest month on an average of about 100mm month-1, and only 20\% dry days throughout the year. Rain gauges at a mutual distance of less than 4000m are strongly correlated, with a Pearson correlation coefficient higher than 0.8. However, even within this perimeter, spatial variability in average rainfall is very high. Significant correlations were found between average daily rainfall and geographical location, as well as the topographical parameters slope, aspect, topography. Spatial interpolation with thiessen gives good results. Kriging gives better results than thiessen, and the accuracy of both methods improves when external trends are incorporated.},

Increases in the frequency and size of wildfires throughout the western USA can be attributed to increases in the number of fire ignitions, fire suppression practices, and climatic influences. Increased urbanization throughout the western USA, combined with the increased wildfire magnitude and frequency, carries with it the increased threat of subsequent debris-flow occurrence. Differences between rainfall thresholds and empirical debris-flow susceptibility models for southern California and the intermountain west indicate a strong influence of climatic and geologic settings on post-fire debris-flow potential. The linkages between wildfires, debris-flow occurrence, and global warming suggests that the experiences in the western United States are highly likely to be duplicated in many other parts of the world, and necessitate hazard assessment tools that are specific to local climates and physiographies.},

  abstract = {Following wildfires, emergency-response and public-safety agencies are faced often with making evacuation decisions and deploying resources both well in advance of each coming winter storm and during storms themselves. Information critical to this process is provided for recently burned areas in the San Gabriel Mountains of southern California. The National Weather Service (NWS) issues Quantitative Precipitation Forecasts (QPFs) for the San Gabriel Mountains twice a day, at approximately 4 a.m. and 4 p.m., along with unscheduled updates when conditions change. QPFs provide estimates of rainfall totals in 3-hour increments for the first 12-hour period and in 6-hour increments for the second 12-hour period. Estimates of one-hour rainfall intensities can be provided in the forecast narrative, along with probable peak intensities and timing, although with less confidence than rainfall totals. A compilation of information on the hydrologic response to winter storms from recently burned areas in southern California steeplands was used to develop a system for classifying the magnitude of the postfire hydrologic response. The four-class system is based on a combination of the reported volume of individual debris flows, the consequences of these events in an urban setting, and the spatial extent of the response to the triggering storm. Threshold rainfall conditions associated with debris flow and floods of different magnitude classes are defined by integrating local rainfall data with debris-flow and flood magnitude information. The within-storm rainfall accumulations (A) and durations (D) above which magnitude I events are expected are defined by A=0.3D0.6. The function A=0.5D0.6 defines the within-storm rainfall accumulations and durations above which a magnitude III event will occur in response to a regional-scale storm, and a magnitude II event will occur if the storm affects only a few drainage basins. The function A=1.0D0.5defines the rainfall conditions above which magnitude III events can be expected. Rainfall trigger-magnitude relations are linked with potential emergency-response actions in the form of an emergency-response decision chart. The chart leads a user through steps to determine potential event magnitudes, and identify possible evacuation and resource-deployment levels as a function of either individual storm forecasts or measured precipitation during storms. The ability to use this information in the planning and response decision-making process may result in significant financial savings and increased safety for both the public and emergency responders.},

  abstract = {Debris flows generated during rain storms on recently burned areas have destroyed lives and property throughout the Western U.S. Field evidence indicate that unlike landslide-triggered debris flows, these events have no identifiable initiation source and can occur with little or no antecedent moisture. Using rain gage and response data from five fires in Colorado and southern California, we document the rainfall conditions that have triggered post-fire debris flows and develop empirical rainfall intensity\textendash duration thresholds for the occurrence of debris flows and floods following wildfires in these settings. This information can provide guidance for warning systems and planning for emergency response in similar settings. Debris flows were produced from 25 recently burned basins in Colorado in response to 13 short-duration, high-intensity convective storms. Debris flows were triggered after as little as six to 10~min of storm rainfall. About 80\% of the storms that generated debris flows lasted less than 3~h, with most of the rain falling in less than 1~h. The storms triggering debris flows ranged in average intensity between 1.0 and 32.0~mm/h, and had recurrence intervals of two years or less. Threshold rainfall conditions for floods and debris flows sufficiently large to pose threats to life and property from recently burned areas in south-central, and southwestern, Colorado are defined by: I=6.5D-~0.7 and I=9.5D-~0.7, respectively, where I=rainfall intensity (in mm/h) and D=duration (in hours). Debris flows were generated from 68 recently burned areas in southern California in response to long-duration frontal storms. The flows occurred after as little as two hours, and up to 16~h, of low-intensity (2\textendash 10~mm/h) rainfall. The storms lasted between 5.5 and 33~h, with average intensities between 1.3 and 20.4~mm/h, and had recurrence intervals of two years or less. Threshold rainfall conditions for life- and property-threatening floods and debris flows during the first winter season following fires in Ventura County, and in the San Bernardino, San Gabriel and San Jacinto Mountains of southern California are defined by I=12.5D-0.4, and I=7.2D-0.4, respectively. A threshold defined for flood and debris-flow conditions following a year of vegetative recovery and sediment removal for the San Bernardino, San Gabriel and San Jacinto Mountains of I=14.0D-0.5 is approximately 25~mm/h higher than that developed for the first year following fires. The thresholds defined here are significantly lower than most identified for unburned settings, perhaps because of the difference between extremely rapid, runoff-dominated processes acting in burned areas and longer-term, infiltration-dominated processes on unburned hillslopes.},

  abstract = {A torrential rainstorm on September 1, 1994 at the recently burned hillslopes of Storm King Mountain, CO, resulted in the generation of debris flows from every burned drainage basin. Maps (1:5000 scale) of bedrock and surficial materials and of the debris-flow paths, coupled with a 10-m Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of topography, are used to evaluate the processes that generated fire-related debris flows in this setting. These evaluations form the basis for a descriptive model for fire-related debris-flow initiation. The prominent paths left by the debris flows originated in 0- and 1st-order hollows or channels. Discrete soil-slip scars do not occur at the heads of these paths. Although 58 soil-slip scars were mapped on hillslopes in the burned basins, material derived from these soil slips accounted for only about 7\% of the total volume of material deposited at canyon mouths. This fact, combined with observations of significant erosion of hillslope materials, suggests that a runoff-dominated process of progressive sediment entrainment by surface runoff, rather than infiltration-triggered failure of discrete soil slips, was the primary mechanism of debris-flow initiation. A paucity of channel incision, along with observations of extensive hillslope erosion, indicates that a significant proportion of material in the debris flows was derived from the hillslopes, with a smaller contribution from the channels. Because of the importance of runoff-dominated rather than infiltration-dominated processes in the generation of these fire-related debris flows, the runoff-contributing area that extends upslope from the point of debris-flow initiation to the drainage divide, and its gradient, becomes a critical constraint in debris-flow initiation. Slope-area thresholds for fire-related debris-flow initiation from Storm King Mountain are defined by functions of the form Acr(tan\texttheta )3=S, where Acr is the critical area extending upslope from the initiation location to the drainage divide, and tan\texttheta{} is its gradient. The thresholds vary with different materials.},

Geological, geotechnical, geomorphological and seismologicaldata were integrated into a standard earthquake slope stability model. The model assessed thelandslide potential that existed during the 1980 Irpinian earthquake in the Upper Sele river Valley.The standard Newmark displacement analysis, widely used for predicting the location of shallowunstable slopes, does not take into account errors and/or uncertainties in the input parameters.Therefore, a probabilistic Newmark displacement analysis technique has been used. Probabilistictechniques allow, e.g., an estimation of the probability that a slope will exceed a certain criticalvalue of Newmark displacement. In our probabilistic method, a Monte-Carlo based simulation modelis used in conjunction with a GIS. The random variability of geotechnical data is modelled by probabilitydensity functions (pdfs), while for the seismic input three different regression laws wereconsidered. Input probability distributions are sampled and the resulting values input into empiricalrelations for estimating Newmark displacement. The outcome is a map in which to each siteis related a spatial probability distribution for the expected displacement in response to seismic loading.Results of the experiments show a high grade of uncertainty in the application of the Newmarkanalysis both for the deterministic and probabilistic approach in a complex geological setting suchas the high Sele valley, quite common in the Southern Apennines. They show a strong dependence onthe reliability of the spatial data used in input, so that, when the model is used at basin scale,results are strongly influenced by local environmental condition (e.g., topography, lithology, groundwatercondition) and decrease the model performance.},

As a consequence of the most severe shocks, several landslides were triggered on bedrock, calcareous debris and sandy clay deposits. The landslide inventory, collected in the field and by aerial-photo interpretation, provided an opportunity to test the accuracy of existing predictive relations for landslide hazard zoning and to formulate new ones. Shallow soil slides and debris slides were selected to verify the prediction performance of the methods, which are based on a simplified model [Geotechnique 15 (1965) 139] that calculate landslide displacements during cyclic seismic loading. Rock falls were modeled using a different approach to produce an empirical predictive rule for determining the probability of detachment of blocks. When landslides occur along pre-existing or newly formed failure surfaces, the Arias intensity and destructiveness potential are the strong ground-motion parameters that best relate to displacements. The predictive relation proposed for rock falls evaluates the probability of occurrence as a function of the slope angle and the peak ground acceleration (PGA).},

  abstract = {In many developing countries, such as Cuba, landslide-affected areas are not systematically mapped in a national inventory and no ``regional to local'' approach for landslide hazard and risk assessment has been carried out so far. Most of the conventional landslide studies in Cuba are qualitative in nature and focus on description of phenomena or on landslide susceptibility assessment. Moreover, most of the quantitative landslides risk assessment methodologies that have been developed elsewhere are very case-specific and require many types of data, on landslide occurrences and impacts, most of which are not available in Cuba. This research is aiming at the development of a methodology for spatial landslide risk assessment for the Civil Defence in Cuba, taking into account the conditions of Cuba regarding the required levels (scales) of analysis, the triggering factors and the data availability. It aims at implementing the methodology in four case study areas at national level (1:1,000,000 scale), provincial level (1:100,000 scale), municipal level (1:50,000 scale) and local level (1:25,000 scale). This hierarchical approach will allow comparing the suitability of risk assessment methods at each level for the specific conditions of Cuba. The research will focus on the generation of a national landslide inventory database, which should provide the magnitude and frequency information needed for risk assessment. The landslide inventory will be carried out by setting up a landslide-reporting system by staff from the 169 local Civil Defence branches in Cuba, and by multitemporal airphoto and satellite image interpretation, using visual stereoscopic interpretation methods.},

The study is based on a terrain mapping units (TMU) map, generated at 1:50,000 scale by interpretation of aerial photos, satellite images and field data. Information describing 603 terrain units was collected in a database. Landslide areas were mapped in detail to classify the different failure types and parts. Three major landslide regions are recognized in the study area: coastal hills with rockfalls, shallow debris flows and old rotational rockslides denudational slopes in limestone, with very large deep-seated rockslides related to tectonic activity and the Sierra de Caujer\'i scarp, with large rockslides. The Caujer\'i scarp presents the highest hazard, with recent landslides and various signs of active processes. The different landforms and the causative factors for landslides were analyzed and used to develop the heuristic model. The model is based on weights assigned by expert judgment and organized in a number of components such as slope angle, internal relief, slope shape, geological formation, active faults, distance to drainage, distance to springs, geomorphological subunits and existing landslide zones. From these variables a hierarchical heuristic model was applied in which three levels of weights were designed for classes, variables, and criteria. The model combines all weights into a single hazard value for each pixel of the landslide hazard map. The hazard map was then divided by two scales, one with three classes for disaster managers and one with 10 detailed hazard classes for technical staff. The range of weight values and the number of existing landslides is registered for each class. The resulting increasing landslide density with higher hazard classes indicates that the output map is reliable. The landslide hazard map was used in combination with existing information on buildings and infrastructure to prepare a qualitative risk map. The complete lack of historical landslide information and geotechnical data precludes the development of quantitative deterministic or probabilistic models.},

  abstract = {A new complete map of soil series probabilities has been produced for the contiguous United States at a 30m spatial resolution. This innovative database, named POLARIS, is constructed using available high-resolution geospatial environmental data and a state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm (DSMART-HPC) to remap the Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) database. This 9 billion grid cell database is possible using available high performance computing resources. POLARIS provides a spatially continuous, internally consistent, quantitative prediction of soil series. It offers potential solutions to the primary weaknesses in SSURGO: 1) unmapped areas are gap-filled using survey data from the surrounding regions, 2) the artificial discontinuities at political boundaries are removed, and 3) the use of high resolution environmental covariate data leads to a spatial disaggregation of the coarse polygons. The geospatial environmental covariates that have the largest role in assembling POLARIS over the contiguous United States (CONUS) are fine-scale (30m) elevation data and coarse-scale (\textasciitilde 2km) estimates of the geographic distribution of uranium, thorium, and potassium. A preliminary validation of POLARIS using the NRCS National Soil Information System (NASIS) database shows variable performance over CONUS. In general, the best performance is obtained at grid cells where DSMART-HPC is most able to reduce the chance of misclassification. The important role of environmental covariates in limiting prediction uncertainty suggests including additional covariates is pivotal to improving POLARIS' accuracy. This database has the potential to improve the modeling of biogeochemical, water, and energy cycles in environmental models; enhance availability of data for precision agriculture; and assist hydrologic monitoring and forecasting to ensure food and water security.},

  abstract = {This study proposes a novel method that combines a deterministic slope stability model and a statistical model for predicting rainfall-induced landslides. The method first uses the deterministic model to derive the rainfall rate critical to induce slope failure for each land unit. Then it calculates the difference between the critical rainfall threshold and estimated rainfall intensity. Using the difference and estimated rainfall duration as explanatory variables, the method derives a logit (integrated) model to compute landslide occurrence probabilities. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, the study used radar rainfall estimates and landslides associated with a typhoon (tropical cyclone) to develop the integrated model and the same types of data associated with another typhoon to validate the model. The model had a modified success rate of 84.0\% for predicting landslides and stable areas, and model validation yielded a modified success rate of 87.4\%. Both rates were better than those from the critical rainfall model. The main advantage of the integrated model lies in its use of rainfall variables that are not included in calculating the critical rainfall. Also, as a probabilistic model, the integrated model is better suited for decision-making in watershed management. This study has advanced the method for predicting rainfall-triggered landslides.},

  abstract = {Landslides can be caused by storms and earthquakes. Most logistic regression models proposed in recent years have been targeted at rainfall-induced landslides. In areas such as Taiwan, where landslides can be triggered by typhoons (tropical cyclones) and earthquakes, a rainfall-induced model is insufficient because it provides only a partial explanation of landslide occurrence and overlooks the potential effect of earthquakes on typhoon-triggered landslides. This study used landslides triggered by a major earthquake and a typhoon prior to the earthquake to develop an earthquake-induced model and a typhoon-induced model. The models were then validated by using landslides triggered by three typhoons after the earthquake. According to the results, typhoon-triggered landslides tended to be near stream channels and earthquake-triggered landslides were more likely to be near ridge lines. Moreover, a major earthquake could still affect the locations of typhoon-triggered landslides 6~years after the earthquake. This study therefore demonstrates that an earthquake-induced model both sheds light on the environmental factors for triggering landslides, and augments a rainfall-induced model in its predictive capability in areas such as Taiwan.},

Based on 1448 landslide data from 1984 to 1998, the diurnal and seasonal distributions of landslides are established and compared with the seasonal rainfall variation. The cumulative fatalities and injuries caused by landslides increase with the cumulative rainfall in Hong Kong, indicating a strong correlation between rainfall and landslide consequences. The average annual fatality and injury rates in Hong Kong caused by landslide are 11.35 and 11.63, respectively. In terms of being hit by a landslide, squatter areas and roads on Hong Kong Island are at the highest risk. A frequency\textendash volume relation for Hong Kong Island was established, and, using this relation, it was estimated that the return period of a 26,000m3 landslide (the size of 1995 Shum Wan Road Landslide) is about 3.12 years. A hazard zonation map for Hong Kong Island is established by using historical data. The potential use of GIS technology to incorporate various layers of information is illustrated using Hong Kong Island as an example.

Regional bias of the landslide inventory is examined by dividing the whole HKI into a southern and a northern region, separated by an east-west trending water divide. It was found that the susceptibility map of southern HKI generated by using the southern data differs significantly from that generated by using northern data, and similar conclusion can be drawn for the northern HKI. Therefore, a susceptibility map of HKI was established based on regional data analysis, and it was found to reflect closely the spatial distributions of historical landslides. Elevation appears to be the most dominant factor in controlling landslide occurrence, and this probably reflects that human developments are concentrated at certain elevations on the island. Classification plot, goodness of fit, and occurrence ratio were used to examine the reliability of the proposed susceptibility map. The size of landslide susceptible zones varies depending on the data sets used, thus this demonstrates that the historical landslide data may be biased and affected by human activities and geological settings on a regional basis. Therefore, indiscriminate use of regional-biased data should be avoided.},

  abstract = {This paper quantifies the relationship between forward scattered L-band Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals, recorded by the Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) constellation and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) soil moisture (SM). Although designed for tropical ocean surface wind sensing, the CYGNSS receivers also record GNSS reflections over land. The CYGNSS observations of reflection power are compared to SMAP SM between March 2017 and February 2018. A strong, positive linear relationship exists between changes in CYGNSS reflectivity and changes in SMAP SM, but not between the absolute magnitudes of the two observations. The sensitivity of CYGNSS reflectivity to SM varies spatially and can be used to convert reflectivity to estimates of SM. The unbiased root-mean-square difference between daily averaged CYGNSS-derived SM and SMAP SM is 0.045 cm3/cm3 and is similarly low between CYGNSS and in situ SM. These results show that CYGNSS, and future GNSS reflection missions, could provide global SM observations. Plain Language Summary Satellite remote sensing of near-surface soil moisture is needed to improve weather forecasts and climate models. This is normally accomplished using one of two types of instruments: a radiometer, which provides data every 2\textendash 3 days but with a spatial resolution of \textasciitilde 40 km, or a monostatic radar, which provides data once every few weeks, but with subkilometer spatial resolution. These instruments are expensive\textemdash National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission cost upward of a billion dollars. Here we present evidence that there is a third option for soil moisture remote sensing, which is hundreds of millions of dollars less expensive than current instruments and provides approximately daily data with few kilometers spatial sensitivity. This third method uses transmitted Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals, which are recorded by the Cyclone GNSS (CYGNSS) constellation of eight satellites. We show that these data are sensitive to soil moisture changes across a broad range of environments and through time. There are strong linear relationships between CYGNSS data and SMAP data, as well as ground-based observations. The data are currently available and could be used to infill the 2- to 3-day SMAP time series.},

This study investigates the use of TRMM and ERA-Interim data, for the determination of rainfall thresholds and the prediction of precipitation, respectively, to be used for landslide early warning purposes at the Bogowonto catchment, Central Java, Indonesia. A landslide inventory of 218 landslides for the period of 2003\textendash 2016 was compiled, and rainfall data were retrieved for the landslide locations, as given by 6 ground stations, TRMM, and ERA-Interim data. First, rainfall data from the three different sources was compared in terms of correlation and extreme precipitation indices. Second, a procedure for the calculation of rainfall thresholds for landslide occurrence was followed consisting of four steps: i) the TRMM-based rainfall data was reconstructed for selected dates and locations characterized by landslide occurrence and non-occurrence; ii) the antecedent daily rainfall was calculated for 3, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 days for the selected dates and locations; iii) two-parameter daily rainfall-antecedent rainfall thresholds were calculated for the aforementioned dates; after analysis of the curves the optimum number of antecedent rainfall days was selected; and (iv) empirical rainfall thresholds for landslide occurrence were determined. The procedure was repeated for the entire landslide dataset, differentiating between forested and built-up areas, and between landslide occurrence in four temporal periods, in relation to the monsoon. The results indicated that TRMM performs well for the detection of very heavy precipitation and can be used to indicate the extreme rainfall events that trigger landslides. On the contrary, as ERA-Interim failed to detect those events, its applicability for LEWS remains limited. The 15-day antecedent rainfall was indicated to mostly affect the landslide occurrence in the area. The rainfall thresholds vary for forested and built-up areas, as well as for the beginning, middle and end of the rainy season.},

In fact, in this method landslide susceptibility is simply expressed as landslide density in correspondence with different combinations of instability-factor classes. To overcome the operational complexity connected to the long, tedious and error prone sequence of commands required by the procedure, a shell script mainly based on the GRASS GIS was created. The script, starting from a landslide inventory map and a number of factor maps, automatically carries out the whole procedure resulting in the construction of a map with five landslide susceptibility classes. A validation procedure allows to assess the reliability of the resulting model, while the simple mean deviation of the density values in the factor class combinations, helps to evaluate the goodness of landslide density distribution. The procedure was applied to a relatively small basin (167 km2) in the Italian Northern Apennines considering three landslide types, namely rotational slides, flows and complex landslides, for a total of 1,137 landslides, and five factors, namely lithology, slope angle and aspect, elevation and slope/bedding relations. The analysis of the resulting 31 different models obtained combining the five factors, confirms the role of lithology, slope angle and slope/bedding relations in influencing slope stability.},

  abstract = {Numerous methods have been proposed for landslide probability zonation of the landscape by means of a Geographic Information System (GIS). Among the multivariate methods, i.e. those methods which simultaneously take into account all the factors contributing to instability, the Conditional Analysis method applied to a subdivision of the territory into Unique Condition Units is particularly straightforward from a conceptual point of view and particularly suited to the use of a GIS. In fact, working on the principle that future landslides are more likely to occur under those conditions which led to past instability, landslide susceptibility is defined by computing the landslide density in correspondence with different combinations of instability factors. The conceptual simplicity of this method, however, does not necessarily imply that it is simple to implement, especially as it requires rather complex operations and a high number of GIS commands. Moreover, there is the possibility that, in order to achieve satisfactory results, the procedure has to be repeated a few times changing the factors or modifying the class subdivision. To solve this problem, we created a shell program which, by combining the shell commands, the GIS Geographical Research Analysis Support System (GRASS) commands and the gawk language commands, carries out the whole procedure automatically. This makes the construction of a Landslide Susceptibility Map easy and fast for large areas too, and even when a high spatial resolution is adopted, as shown by application of the procedure to the Parma River basin, in the Italian Northern Apennines.},

Debris flows were initiated by water runoff from colluvium and bedrock that entrained sediment from rills and channels with slopes ranging from about 14\textdegree{} to 45\textdegree. The availability of channel material is essentially unlimited because of thick channel fill and refilling following debris flows by rock fall and dry ravel processes. Rainfall exceeding I=6.61(D)-0.77, where I is rainfall intensity (mm/h), and D is duration (h), was required for the initiation of debris flows in the drainage basin. The approximate minimum runoff discharge from the surface of bedrock required to initiate debris flows in the channels was 0.15~m3/s. Colluvium in the basin was unsaturated immediately prior to (antecedent) and during debris flows. Antecedent, volumetric moisture levels in colluvium at depths of 1~cm and 29~cm ranged from 4\textendash 9\%, and 4\textendash 7\%, respectively. During debris flows, peak moisture levels in colluvium at depths of 1~cm and 29~cm ranged from 10\textendash 20\%, and 4\textendash 12\%, respectively. Channel sediment at a depth of 45~cm was unsaturated before and during debris flows; antecedent moisture ranged from 20\textendash 22\%, and peak moisture ranged from 24\textendash 38\%. Although we have no measurements from shallow rill or channel sediment, we infer that it was unsaturated before debris flows, and saturated by surface-water runoff during debris flows. Our results allow us to make the following general statements with regard to debris flows generated by runoff in semi-arid to arid mountainous regions: 1) high antecedent moisture levels in hillslope and channel sediment are not required for the initiation of debris flows by runoff, 2) locations of entrainment of sediment by successive runoff events can vary within a basin as a function of variations in the thickness of existing channel fill and the rate of replenishment of channel fill by rock fall and dry ravel processes following debris flows, and 3) rainfall and simulated surface-water discharge thresholds can be useful in understanding and predicting debris flows generated by runoff and sediment entrainment.},

A 5.4-m-long sediment core produced a stratigraphic and pollen record spanning the last 5200 yr. Three major zones are distinguishable in the core. The lowermost zone (5200 to 3250 yr B.P.) represents a time of arid climate with predominantly marine sediment input and high Chenopodiaceae and Ambrosia pollen values. The intermediate zone (3250 yr B.P. to 1800 A.D.) is characterized by greater fresh water input and high values for Asteraceae and Cyperaceae pollen and charcoal particles. The uppermost zone (1800 A.D. to present) documents the unprecedented erosion, sedimentation, and vegetation change that resulted from the introduction of large exotic herbivores and exotic plants to the island during Anglo-European settlement. The identification of pollen grains of Torrey Pine (Pinus torreyana) documents the persistence of this endemic species on the island throughout the middle to late Holocene.},

NLDAS observation-based shortwave values are derived from Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite radiation data processed at the University of Maryland and at the National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service. Extensive quality control and validation efforts have been conducted on the NLDAS forcing data sets, and favorable comparisons have taken place with Oklahoma Mesonet, Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program/cloud and radiation test bed, and Surface Radiation observation data.

  abstract = {Accurate partitioning of precipitation into infiltration and runoff is a fundamental objective of land surface models tasked with characterizing the surface water and energy balance. Temporal variability in this partitioning is due, in part, to changes in prestorm soil moisture, which determine soil infiltration capacity and unsaturated storage. Utilizing the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Soil Moisture Active Passive Level-4 soil moisture product in combination with streamflow and precipitation observations, we demonstrate that land surface models (LSMs) generally underestimate the strength of the positive rank correlation between prestorm soil moisture and event runoff coefficients (i.e., the fraction of rainfall accumulation volume converted into stormflow runoff during a storm event). Underestimation is largest for LSMs employing an infiltration-excess approach for stormflow runoff generation. More accurate coupling strength is found in LSMs that explicitly represent subsurface stormflow or saturation-excess runoff generation processes. Plain Language Summary Hydrologic models attempt to predict the fraction of incoming rainfall, which is converted into runoff (versus infiltrated into the soil). If accurate, these predictions are valuable for a wide range of agricultural water use and water management applications. The ability of the land surface to infiltrate rainfall is largely dependent on the amount of water present in the soil column prior to the start of a storm event. Using a new satellite-based soil moisture data product, this paper examines whether existing hydrologic models can accurately reproduce the correct relationship between prestorm soil moisture and rainfall infiltration. Results indicate that models tend to underestimate the strength of this relationship and therefore underutilize available soil moisture information for predicting the land surface response to future rainfall. Results in this paper will eventually be used to correct for this bias and enhance our ability to predict streamflow extremes associated with floods and droughts.},

It identifies the mechanisms by which climate can induce landsliding and examines the manner in which these mechanisms may respond to changes in a range of climatic parameters. It is argued that inherent limiting stability factors, which vary with different terrain conditions and landslide types, ultimately govern the nature of response to changing climate. Several modelling approaches are evaluated on the basis of their potential to predict landslide response to climate projections. Given reliable input data of appropriate form and resolution, the existing slope stability, hydrological, and statistical models are for the most part capable of yielding useful prognoses on occurrence, reactivation, magnitude and frequency of landsliding. While there is a strong theoretical basis for increased landslide activity as a result of predicted climate change, there remains a high level of uncertainty resulting from the margins of error inherent in scenario-driven global climate predictions, and the lack of sufficient spatial resolution of currently available downscaled projections. Examples from New Zealand are used to illustrate the extent to which changes resulting from human activity have affected slope stability. Changes resulting from human activity are seen as a factor of equal, if not greater, importance than climate change in affecting the temporal and spatial occurrence of landslides.},

The model, referred to as the Antecedent Water Status Model, calculates an index of soil water, by running a daily water balance and applying a soil drainage factor to excess precipitation, over the preceding ten days. Together with the daily rainfall input, the soil water status has been used empirically to identify a threshold condition for landslide triggering. The prediction process provides a daily update of the soil water status and thereby the amount of rainfall required on the following day to equal or exceed the triggering threshold. The probability that this triggering rainfall will occur is then determined from the frequency/magnitude distribution of the local rainfall record.

It brought overwhelming destruction to eight provinces and cities. Landslides and rock avalanches triggered by the earthquake produced 257 landslide lakes which were distributed along the fault rupture zone and river channels. The authors traveled to the disaster zone immediately after the earthquake to examine some of the features of the debris dams and performed a quick evaluation of the potential for outburst of earthquake-induced landslide lakes for the purpose of disaster relief. The preliminary analysis indicated that the landslide lakes could be classified as those exhibiting extremely high risk, medium risk, and low risk according to field observations and remote sensing, to determine material composition, dam structure, dam height, maximum water storage capacity, and size of the population potentially affected area. The failure risk of 21 debris dams were evaluated as follows: one dam with an extremely high danger risk, seven dams with a high danger, five dams with a medium danger, and eight dams of low danger. More concern was given to the Tangjiashan Lake and different scenarios for the potential sudden failure of its dam were assessed. The risk evaluation result was accepted in full, by the earthquake disaster relief office. A successful emergency dam treatment for risk reduction was planned, based on our assessments, and these measures were quickly carried out. According to this research, the earthquake destabilized the surrounding mountains, resulting in a prolonged geohazard for the area. Landslides and debris flows will continue to develop for at least 5 to 10 years after the Wenchuan earthquake and will produce additional dammed lakes. Recommendations and plans for earthquake\textendash landslide lake mitigation were proposed, based on past successful practices.},

  abstract = {Debris flows are typically caused by natural terrain landslides triggered by intense rainfalls. If an incoming mountain torrent collapses a series of landslide dams, large debris flows can form in a very short period. Moreover, the torrent can amplify the scale of the debris flow in the flow direction. The catastrophic debris flows that occurred in Zhouqu, China, on 8 August 2010 were caused by intense rainfall and the upstream cascading failure of landslide dams along the gullies. In the wake of the incident, a field study was conducted to better understand the process of cascading landslide dam failures and the formation of debris flows. This paper looks at the geomorphic properties of the debris-flow gullies, estimates the peak flow discharges at different locations using three different methods, and analyzes the key modes (i.e., different landslide dam types and their combinations) of cascading landslide dam failures and their effect on the scale amplification of debris flows. The results show that five key modes in Luojiayu gully and two modes in Sanyanyu gully accounted for the scale amplification of downstream debris flows in the Zhouqu event. This study illustrates how the hazardous process of natural debris flows can begin several kilometers upstream as a complex cascade of geomorphic events (failure of landslide dams and erosion of the sloping bed) can scale to become catastrophic discharges. Neglecting recognition of these hazardous geomorphic and hydrodynamic processes may result in a high cost.},

  abstract = {Wildfires change the hydrologic and geomorphic response of watersheds, resulting in a cascade of increased hazards for sediment-laden floods, shallow landslides, and debris flows. This phenomenon has long been studied in regions where landscape evolution is driven by repeated fire-flood sequences such as Southern California. However, comparing mass movement hazards across multiple regions presents a challenge because most landslide inventories are limited to local or regional spatial scales. This study seeks to identify unique triggering characteristics of post-fire landslides through a comparison of the precipitation characteristics preceding landslides at both burned and unburned locations spanning six global regions. Regional inter-comparison was facilitated by selecting landslide events from the NASA Global Landslide Catalog (GLC), and then establishing fire and precipitation histories for each site using MODIS global burned area and CHIRPS precipitation data, respectively. Analysis of normalized seven-day accumulated precipitation for sites across all regions shows that landslides at burned sites are preceded by less precipitation than landslides without antecedent burn events. This supports the hypothesis that fire increases the rainfall-driven landslide hazards. A regional examination of landslide susceptibility using normalized triggering storm volumes as a proxy indicator reveals a distinct sensitivity to fire across several regions of western North America. However, in other regions wildfire appears to have a limited or even opposite impact on landslide susceptibility. Unburned locations tend to see a sharper ramp-up of precipitation leading up to the date of the landslide relative to burned sites in regions of western North America. In other regions like Central America, the storm timing is similar or even longer in burned locations. The landslide-triggering storms in post-fire locations tend to exhibit different seasonality from other rainfall-triggered landslides, with a variety of seasonal shifts ranging from approximately six months in the Pacific Northwest of the United States (US) to one week in the Himalaya region. These results suggest that the apparent inconsistency in the impact of wildfire on landslide hazards may be due to interactions between fire and precipitation seasonality in addition to regional variation in susceptibility to specific types of landslide mechanisms. For example, in the Intermountain West of North America and Southeast Asia, landslides are preceded by a thirty-day or longer dry period while in all other regions there is no difference in the precipitation prior to the triggering storm event, which suggests different landslide mechanisms which rely on low rather than high antecedent soil moisture levels may be at work. Overall, this work offers an exploration of regional differences in the characteristics of rainfall-triggered landslides over a broad spatial scale encompassing a variety of climates, terrains, and ecoregions.},

  abstract = {Extreme precipitation can have profound consequences for communities, resulting in natural hazards such as rainfall-triggered landslides that cause casualties and extensive property damage. A key challenge to understanding and predicting rainfall-triggered landslides comes from observational uncertainties in the depth and intensity of precipitation preceding the event. Practitioners and researchers must select among a wide range of precipitation products, often with little guidance. Here we evaluate the degree of precipitation uncertainty across multiple precipitation products for a large set of landslide-triggering storm events and investigate the impact of these uncertainties on predicted landslide probability using published intensity-duration thresholds. The average intensity, peak intensity, duration, and NOAA-Atlas return periods are compared ahead of 228 reported landslides across the continental US and Canada. Precipitation data are taken from four products that cover disparate measurement methods: near real-time and post-processed satellite (IMERG), radar (MRMS), and gauge-based (NLDAS-2). Landslide-triggering precipitation was found to vary widely across precipitation products with the depth of individual storm events diverging by as much as 296 mm with an average range of 51 mm. Peak intensity measurements, which are typically influential in triggering landslides, were also highly variable with an average range of 7.8 mm/hr and as much as 57 mm/hr. The two products more reliant upon ground-based observations (MRMS and NLDAS-2) performed better at identifying landslides according to published intensity-duration storm thresholds, but all products exhibited hit-ratios of greater than 0.56. A greater proportion of landslides were predicted when including only manually-verified landslide locations. We recommend practitioners consider low-latency products like MRMS for investigating landslides, given their near-real time data availability and good performance in detecting landslides. Practitioners would be well-served considering more than one product as a way to confirm intense storm signals and minimize the influence of noise and false alarms.},

For example, more than 800 slope failures were triggered by a rainstorm in November 1993 on Lantau Island, Hong Kong. Maps of recent landslides interpreted from aerial photographs, in combination with a geographical information system, were used to evaluate the frequency and distribution of landslides, with particular reference to such physical parameters as lithology, slope gradient, slope aspect, elevation, vegetation cover, and proximity to drainage line, all of which are considered to be influential in the occurrence of landslides. A stepwise logistic regression model was obtained between landslide susceptibility and the above mentioned physical parameters. The study area has been classified into five classes of relative landslide susceptibility, namely, very low, low, moderate, high, and very high, based on this methodology.},

This paper reports on the use of a Geographical Information Systems (GIS) database, compiled primarily from existing digital maps and aerial photographs, to describe the physical characteristics of landslides and the statistical relations of landslide frequency with the physical parameters contributing to the initiation of landslides on Lantau Island in Hong Kong. The horizontal travel length and the angle of reach, defined as the angle of the line connecting the head of the landslide source to the distal margin of the displaced mass, are used to describe runout behavior of landslide mass. For all landslides studied, the horizontal travel length of landslide mass ranges from 5 to 785 m, with a mean value of 43 m, and the average angle of reach is 27.7\textdegree. This GIS database is then used to obtain a logistic multiple regression model for predicting slope instability. It is indicated that slope gradient, lithology, elevation, slope aspect, and land-use are statistically significant in predicting slope instability, while slope morphology and proximity to drainage lines are not important and thus excluded from the model. This model is then imported back into the GIS to produce a map of predicted slope instability.

In order to mitigate landslide hazard effectively, new methodologies are required to develop a better understanding of landslide hazard and to make rational decisions on the allocation of funds for management of landslide risk. Recent advances in risk analysis and risk assessment are beginning to provide systematic and rigorous processes to enhance slope management. In recent years, risk analysis and assessment has become an important tool in addressing uncertainty inherent in landslide hazards. This article reviews recent advances in landslide risk assessment and management, and discusses the applicability of a variety of approaches to assessing landslide risk. Firstly, a framework for landslide risk assessment and management by which landslide risk can be reduced is proposed. This is followed by a critical review of the current state of research on assessing the probability of landsliding, runout behavior, and vulnerability. Effective management strategies for reducing economic and social losses due to landslides are described. Problems in landslide risk assessment and management are also examined.},

  abstract = {The Ms 8.0 Wenchuan earthquake of May 12, 2008 is one of the most disastrous earthquakes in China. The earthquake triggered tens of thousands of landslides over a broad area, including shallow, disrupted landslides, rock falls, deep-seated landslides, and rock avalanches, some of which buried large sections of some towns and dammed the rivers. The purpose of this study is to investigate correlations between the occurrence of landslides with geologic and geomorphologic conditions, and seismic parameters. Over 56,000 earthquake-triggered landslides, with a total area of 811km2, are interpreted using aerial photographs and remote sensing images taken following the earthquake. The spatial distribution of these landslides is analyzed statistically using both landslide-point density (LPD), defined as the number of landslides per square kilometer, and landslide-area density (LAD), the percentage of the area affected by landslides, to determine how the occurrence of landslides correlates with distance from the epicenter, distance from the major surface rupture, seismic intensity and peak ground acceleration (PGA), slope angle, slope aspect, elevation, and lithology. It is found that both LAD and LPD have strong positive correlations with slope steepness, distance from the major surface rupture and seismic intensity, and that Pre-Sinian schist, and Cambrian sandstone and siltstone intercalated with slate have the most concentrated landslide activities, followed by the Permian limestone intercalated with shale, and Devonian limestone. Statistical analyses also indicate that the major surface rupture has influence on the spatial distribution of landslides, because LAD and LPD are relatively higher on the hanging wall than on the footwall. However, the correlation between the occurrence of landslides with distance from the epicenter of the earthquake is complicated, rather than a relatively simple negative correlation as found from other reported cases of earthquakes. This is possibly due to complicated rupture processes of the earthquake.},

  abstract = {The Federal Republic of Germany has long been among the few European countries that lack a national landslide database. Systematic collection and inventory of landslide data still has a long research history in Germany, but one focussed on the development of databases with local or regional coverage. This has changed in recent years with the launch of a database initiative aimed at closing the data gap existing at national level. The present paper reports on this project that is based on a landslide database which evolved over the last 15years to a database covering large parts of Germany. A strategy of systematic retrieval, extraction, and fusion of landslide data is at the heart of the methodology, providing the basis for a database with a broad potential of application. The database offers a data pool of more than 4,200 landslide data sets with over 13,000 single data files and dates back to the 12th century. All types of landslides are covered by the database, which stores not only core attributes, but also various complementary data, including data on landslide causes, impacts, and mitigation. The current database migration to PostgreSQL/PostGIS is focused on unlocking the full scientific potential of the database, while enabling data sharing and knowledge transfer via a web GIS platform. In this paper, the goals and the research strategy of the database project are highlighted at first, with a summary of best practices in database development providing perspective. Next, the focus is on key aspects of the methodology, which is followed by the results of three case studies in the German Central Uplands. The case study results exemplify database application in the analysis of landslide frequency and causes, impact statistics, and landslide susceptibility modeling. Using the example of these case studies, strengths and weaknesses of the database are discussed in detail. The paper concludes with a summary of the database project with regard to previous achievements and the strategic roadmap.},

Important findings and observed trends from this work include (i) use of AI techniques artificial neural networks (ANN), fuzzy logic (FL), and genetic algorithms (GA) to improve upon or replace traditional physically-based techniques which tend to be computationally expensive; (ii) limitations in scale-up of hydrological processes for watershed modeling; and (iii) the impacts of data resolution on watershed modeling capabilities. In addition, detailed discussions of individual watershed models and modeling systems with their features, limitations, and example applications are presented to demonstrate the wide variety of systems currently available for watershed management at multiple scales. A summary of these discussions is presented in tabular format for use by water resource managers and decision makers as a screening tool for selecting a watershed model for a specific purpose.},

  abstract = {Two alternative procedures for estimating landslide hazards were evaluated using data on topographic digital elevation models (DEMs) and bedrock lithologies in an area adjacent to the Missouri River in Atchison County, Kansas, USA. The two procedures are based on the likelihood ratio model but utilize different assumptions. The empirical likelihood ratio model is based on non-parametric empirical univariate frequency distribution functions under an assumption of conditional independence while the multivariate logistic discriminant model assumes that likelihood ratios can be expressed in terms of logistic functions. The relative hazards of occurrence of landslides were estimated by an empirical likelihood ratio model and by multivariate logistic discriminant analysis. Predictor variables consisted of grids containing topographic elevations, slope angles, and slope aspects calculated from a 30-m DEM. An integer grid of coded bedrock lithologies taken from digitized geologic maps was also used as a predictor variable. Both statistical models yield relative estimates in the form of the proportion of total map area predicted to already contain or to be the site of future landslides. The stabilities of estimates were checked by cross-validation of results from random subsamples, using each of the two procedures. Cell-by-cell comparisons of hazard maps made by the two models show that the two sets of estimates are virtually identical. This suggests that the empirical likelihood ratio and the logistic discriminant analysis models are robust with respect to the conditional independent assumption and the logistic function assumption, respectively, and that either model can be used successfully to evaluate landslide hazards.},

We use a compilation of 75 debris-flow response and fire-ignition dates, vegetation and bedrock class, rainfall regime, and initiation process from throughout the western United States to address these issues. The great majority (85 percent) of debris flows occurred within the first 12 months following wildfire, with 71 percent occurring within the first 6 months. Seven percent of the debris flows occurred between 1 and 1.5 years after a fire, or during the second rainy season to impact an area. Within the first 1.5 years following fires, all but one of the debris flows initiated through runoff-dominated processes, and debris flows occurred in similar proportions in forested and non-forested landscapes. Underlying geologic materials affected how long debris-flow activity persisted, and the timing of debris flows varied within different rainfall regimes. A second, later period of increased debris flow susceptibility between 2.2 and 10 years after fires is indicated by the remaining 8 percent of events, which occurred primarily in forested terrains and initiated largely through landslide processes. The short time period between fire and debris-flow response within the first 1.5 years after ignition and the longer-term response between 2.2 and 10 years after fire demonstrate the necessity of both rapid and long-term reactions by land managers and emergency-response agencies to mitigate hazards from debris flows from recently burned areas in the western United States.},

  abstract = {The North Anatolian Fault is known as one of the most active and destructive fault zones which produced many earthquakes with high magnitudes both in historical and instrumental periods. Along this fault zone, the morphology and the lithological features are prone to landslides. Kuzulu landslide, which is located near the North Anatolian Fault Zone, was triggered by snow melting without any precursor, occurred on March 17, 2005. The landslide resulted in 15 deaths and the destruction of about 30 houses at Kuzulu village. There is still a great danger of further landslides in the region. Therefore, it is vitally important to present its environmental impacts and prepare a landslide susceptibility map of the region. In this study, we used likelihood-frequency ratio model and analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to produce landslide susceptibility maps. For this purpose, a detailed landslide inventory map was prepared and the factors chosen that influence landslide occurrence were: lithology, slope gradient, slope aspect, topographical elevation, distance to stream, distance to roads, distance to faults, drainage density and fault density. The ArcGIS package was used to evaluate and analyze all the collected data. At the end of the susceptibility assessment, the area was divided into five susceptibility regions, such as very low, low, moderate, high and very high. The results of the analyses were then verified using the landslide location data and compared with the probability model. For this purpose, an area under curvature (AUC) and the seed cell area index assessments were applied. An AUC value for the likelihood-frequency ratio-based model 0.78 was obtained, whereas the AUC value for the AHP-based model was 0.64. The landslide susceptibility map will help decision makers in site selection and the site-planning process. The map may also be accepted as a basis for landslide risk-management studies to be applied in the study area.},

The Kuzulu (Koyulhisar) landslide, which caused loss of life and property on 17th March 2005, occurred in an area near the country's most important active fault, the North Anatolian Fault Zone. To mitigate and prevent landslide damages, prediction of landslide susceptibility areas based on probabilistic methods has a great importance. The purpose of this study was to produce a landslide susceptibility map by the logistic regression and frequency ratio methodologies for a 733-km2 area near the North Anatolian Fault Zone from the southeast of Niksar to Resadiye in Tokat province. Conditioning parameters, such as elevation, slope gradient, slope aspect, distance to streams, roads, and faults, drainage density, and fault density, were used in the analysis. Before susceptibility analysis, the landslides observed in the area were separated into two groups for use in analysis and verification, respectively. The susceptibility maps produced had five different susceptibility classes such as very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. To test the performance of the susceptibility maps, area under curve (AUC) approach was used. For the logistic regression method, the AUC value was 0.708; while for the frequency rate method, this value was 0.744. According to these AUC values, it could be concluded that the two landslide susceptibility maps obtained were successful.},

  abstract = {Landslide susceptibility maps are vital for disaster management and for planning development activities in the mountainous country like Nepal. In the present study, landslide susceptibility assessment of Mugling\textendash Narayanghat road and its surrounding area is made using bivariate (certainty factor and index of entropy) and multivariate (logistic regression) models. At first, a landslide inventory map was prepared using earlier reports and aerial photographs as well as by carrying out field survey. As a result, 321 landslides were mapped and out of which 241 (75 \%) were randomly selected for building landslide susceptibility models, while the remaining 80 (25 \%) were used for validating the models. The effectiveness of landslide susceptibility assessment using GIS and statistics is based on appropriate selection of the factors which play a dominant role in slope stability. In this case study, the following landslide conditioning factors were evaluated: slope gradient; slope aspect; altitude; plan curvature; lithology; land use; distance from faults, rivers and roads; topographic wetness index; stream power index; and sediment transport index. These factors were prepared from topographic map, drainage map, road map, and the geological map. Finally, the validation of landslide susceptibility map was carried out using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The ROC plot estimation results showed that the susceptibility map using index of entropy model with AUC value of 0.9016 has highest prediction accuracy of 90.16 \%. Similarly, the susceptibility maps produced using logistic regression model and certainty factor model showed 86.29 and 83.57 \% of prediction accuracy, respectively. Furthermore, the ROC plot showed that the success rate of all the three models performed more than 80 \% accuracy (i.e. 89.15 \% for IOE model, 89.10 \% for LR model and 87.21 \% for CF model). Hence, it is concluded that all the models employed in this study showed reasonably good accuracy in predicting the landslide susceptibility of Mugling\textendash Narayanghat road section. These landslide susceptibility maps can be used for preliminary land use planning and hazard mitigation purpose.},

The evaluated satellite rainfall products are the NOAA-CPC African rainfall estimation algorithm (RFE), TRMM-3B42, the CPC morphing technique (CMORPH), PERSIANN, and the Naval Research Laboratory's blended product. These products perform reasonably well over both regions in detecting the occurrence of rainfall. However, performances are poor in estimating the amount of rainfall in each pixel. The correlation coefficients are low and random errors high. The performance was better over Zimbabwe as compared with Ethiopia. Comparing the different products, CMORPH and TRMM-3B42 showed a better performance over Ethiopia, while RFE, CMORPH, and TRMM-3B42 preformed relatively better over Zimbabwe.},

  abstract = {Precipitation variability results from atmospheric circulation and complex site-specific bio-geoclimatic characteristics; therefore, climatic variables are expected to be correlated in a scale-dependent way. This paper studies the influence of topographic co-variables on the spatial variability of precipitation over small regions of complex terrain. For this purpose, the mutual benefits of an integrated geographic information system (GIS) and a geostatistics approach was used for spatial precipitation interpolation from rainfall observations measured at 51 climatic stations in a mountainous region of southern Italy (Benevento province). As no single method is optimal for all regions, it is important to compare the results obtained using alternative methods applied to the same data set. Therefore, besides ordinary kriging examination, two auxiliary variables were added for ordinary co-kriging of annual and seasonal precipitation: terrain elevation data and a topographic index. Cross-validation indicated that the ordinary kriging yielded the largest prediction errors. The smallest prediction errors were produced by a multivariate geostatistical method. However, the results favour the ordinary co-kriging with inclusion of information on the topographic index. The application of co-kriging is particularly justified in areas where there are nearby stations and where landform is very complex. We conclude that ordinary co-kriging is a very flexible and robust interpolation method because it may take into account several properties (soft and hard data) of the landscape.

In order to assess the differential incidence of very predisposing factor to landslides, maps of the various factors considered were drawn up with the aid of IDRISI software (1997). The factors were as follows: the distance from faults, parallelism between the fractures and the landslide scarps, land use, lithology, distance from the streams, orientation and steepness of slopes, orientation of layers compared to the slope. The global analysis of the different incidence of the factors analyzed on the landslides present in the study area was carried out by comparing the respective maps with that of the scarps; in this way the number of pixels forming the scarps which fell into the various classes of the maps was calculated. The result thus obtained can form the basis of an objective assignation of the different ratings to be attributed to the various factors under consideration. In fact, the analysis carried out in this study has shown that the factors act differently and, for every factor, only some of the classes considered have marked importance.},

This study utilizes discriminant analysis based on a Japanese dataset consisting of 43 well documented landslide dams to determine the significant variables, including log-transformed peak flow (or catchment area), and log-transformed dam height, width and length in hierarchical order, which affect the stability of a landslide dam. The high overall prediction power (88.4\% of the 43 training cases are correctly classified) and the high cross-validation accuracy (86\%) demonstrate the robustness of the proposed discriminant models PHWL (with variables including log-transformed peak flow, and log-transformed dam height, width and length) and AHWL (with variables including log-transformed catchment area, and log-transformed dam height, width and length). Compared to a previously proposed ``DBI'' index-based graphic approach, the discriminant model AHV \textendash{} which uses the log-transformed catchment area, dam height, and dam volume as relevant variables \textendash{} shows better ability to evaluate the stability of landslide dams. Although these discriminant models are established using a Japanese dataset only, the present multivariate statistical approach can be applied for an expanded dataset without any difficulty when more completely documented worldwide landslide-dam data are available.},

The PBS can be considered as an extension of the standard particle filter (PF) in which soil moisture is updated within a window of fixed length using all observed soil temperatures in that window. This approach was developed with a view to assimilating temperature observations from distributed temperature sensing (DTS) observations, a technique which can provide temperature observations every meter or less along cables up to kilometers in length. Here, the PBS approach is tested using soil moisture and temperature, and meteorological data from an experimental site in Citra, Florida. Results demonstrate that the PBS provides a statistically significant improvement in estimated soil moisture compared to the PF, with only a marginal increase in computational expense ( {$<$} 3\% of CPU time). This confirms that assimilating a sequence of temperature observations yields a better soil moisture estimate compared to sequential assimilation of individual temperature observations. The impact of observation interval was investigated for both PF and PBS, and the optimal window length was determined for the PBS. While increasing the observation interval is essential to maintain the spread of particle values in the PF, the PBS performance is best when all available observations are assimilated.},

Results demonstrate that a single polarimetric radar image highlights burn areas. Coherence and interferometric radar pairs show the fire scar and debris flow. An unwrapped interferogram shows the location of the debris flow over the 101 Freeway in greater detail than a raw interferogram. We enhanced the interferogram and coherence product of a pair of images acquired before and after the fire and debris flows, which highlights areas of destroyed structures and major damage. We first despeckled the images and then converted the interferogram to four colors and the coherence map to two colors. Analysis of optical imagery between before and after images shows that the debris flows are best identified using visible bands and that near-infrared better highlights the lower part of the flows where more mud was deposited. These simplified products provide more actionable products for disaster responders; the products were downloaded for use by the State of California.},

The model produces slope failures on the basis of a factor-of-safety analysis with the infinite slope model through use of stochastically generated soil and vegetation parameters. Failed material is routed downslope with a rule-based scheme that determines sediment delivery to streams. Sediment from hillslopes and road surfaces is also transported to the channel network. A simple channel routing scheme is implemented to predict basin sediment yield. We demonstrate through an initial application of this model to the Rainy Creek catchment, a tributary of the Wenatchee River, which drains the east slopes of the Cascade Mountains, that the model produces plausible sediment yield and ratios of landsliding and surface erosion when compared to published rates for similar catchments in the Pacific Northwest. A road removal scenario and a basin-wide fire scenario are both evaluated with the model.},

  abstract = {Rainfall is routinely reported as falling in `events' or `storms' whose beginning and end are defined by rainless intervals of a nominated duration (minimum inter-event time, MIT). Rain events commonly exhibit fluctuations in rain rate as well as periods when rain ceases altogether. Event characteristics such as depth, mean rain rate, and the surface runoff volume generated, are defined in relation to the length of the rain event. These derived properties are dependent upon the value of MIT adopted to define the event, and the literature reveals a wide range of MIT criteria. Surprisingly little attention has been paid to this dependency, which limits the inter-comparison of results in published work. The diversity in criteria also diminishes the usefulness of historical data on event durations, rain rates, etc., in attempts to document changes in the rainfall climate. This paper reviews the range of approaches used in the recognition of rain events, and a 5 year pluviograph record from an arid location is analysed. Changing MIT from 15 min to 24 h (lying within the range of published criteria) alters the number of rain events from 550 to 118. The mean rain rate declines from 2{$\cdot$}04 mm h-1 to 0{$\cdot$}94 mm h-1, and the geometric mean event duration rises from 0{$\cdot$}66 h to 3{$\cdot$}98 h. This wide variation in the properties of rain events indicates that more attention needs to be paid to the selection and reporting of event criteria in studies that adopt event-based data analysis. The selection of a MIT criterion is shown to involve a compromise between the independence of widely-spaced events and their increasingly variable intra-event characteristics.

  abstract = {The metric or `observable' properties of intra-event rainfall intermittency (IERI) are quantified using a 10-year record from arid Fowlers Gap, Australia. Rainfall events were delineated using the minimum inter-event time (MIT) criterion, using eight values in the range of 1 h \textendash{} 24 h. Within events, no-rain periods were defined as corresponding to rainfall rates R {$<$} 0.1 mm/h or R {$<$} 0.2 mm/h (both less than typical wet-canopy evaporation rates during rainfall). In this way, rainfall events were subdivided into rain and no-rain periods. Intermittency was characterised using two measures: the fraction of rainless time within an event, and the duration of the longest rainless period. Events identified using a minimum inter-event time (MIT) of 24 h included on average 9.4 h of contiguous no-rain time (47.5\% of the mean event duration), and only 6.8 h of contiguous rain. Total IERI averaged 51.1\% for these events. Events defined with MIT = 6 h (a value commonly adopted in the literature) exhibited a mean of 1.53 h of no-rain and 9.04 h of contiguous rain. Total IERI averaged 13.9\% for these events for R {$<$} 0.1 mm/h, but reached 39.2\% if no-rain periods were taken as those of {$<$}0.2 mm/h. The maximum contiguous no-rain period for events defined using MIT = 6 h was 10.9 h from an event of 12.6 h duration, and this represents 86.5\% of the event duration. Results demonstrate that smaller, shorter, and less intense rainfall events tend to exhibit higher IERI than larger, longer, and more intense events. IERI is relevant to the understanding of land surface processes. Information on the metric properties of IERI in different rainfall types (convective and stratiform) and rainfall climates (arid, maritime, and wet tropical) may prove to have significance for diverse studies in land surface hydrology.

  abstract = {Hydrologic models are often calibrated and validated with streamflow from a limited number of sites, whereas assessment of model performance with internal watershed data can be used to constrain the parameterization of physically based models to verify that specific hydrologic processes are being reasonably simulated. This is particularly important for improving the simulation accuracy of models used to evaluate potential hydrologic responses to land use and climate change. The distributed hydrology soil-vegetation model (DHSVM) was parameterized for the Mica Creek Experimental Watershed in northern Idaho. Performance was assessed based on measured streamflow from nested and paired watersheds, snowpack dynamics, soil moisture, and transpiration estimated from sap flux. In general, DHSVM effectively simulated snowpack dynamics, soil water content, and the streamflow regime. Streamflow simulation for seven subcatchments had model efficiencies ranging between 0.63 and 0.79. Model efficiency of snowpack simulation at a SNOTEL site was 0.95. Some minor discrepancies between simulated and measured values suggested that some processes, such as snow redistribution, were not represented by the model or were insufficiently parameterized for local conditions. A sensitivity analysis indicated that soil porosity, leaf area index, and minimum stomatal resistance were among the most influential parameters that affected variations in the simulated hydrological regime. However, those variables can be reasonably estimated based on field or remote sensing data. Other important parameters, such as saturated hydraulic conductivity, are more difficult to quantify and therefore need to be refined during the calibration phase. A description of the iterative parameter refinement process that was used in the calibration phase of the model is included to assist other researchers in refining model parameterizations.

The field site is within the area burned by the 2010 Fourmile Canyon Fire in Colorado, USA. Physical and hydraulic property characterization included ash thickness, particle size distribution, hydraulic conductivity, and soil water retention curves. Soil water content and matric potential were measured indirectly at several depths below the soil surface to document hydrologic states underneath the ash layer in the unsaturated zone, whereas precipitation and surface runoff were measured directly. Measurements of soil water content showed that almost no water infiltrated below the ash layer into the near-surface soil in the burned site at the storm time scale (i.e., minutes to hours). Runoff generation processes were controlled by and highly sensitive to ash thickness and ash hydraulic properties. The ash layer stored from 97\% to 99\% of rainfall, which was critical for reducing runoff amounts. The hydrologic response to two rain storms with different rainfall amounts, rainfall intensity, and durations, only ten days apart, indicated that runoff generation was predominantly by the saturation-excess mechanism perched at the ash-soil interface during the first storm and predominantly by the infiltration-excess mechanism at the ash surface during the second storm. Contributing area was not static for the two storms and was 4\% (saturation excess) to 68\% (infiltration excess) of the catchment area. Our results showed the importance of including hydrologic conditions and hydraulic properties of the ash layer in postwildfire runoff generation models.},

  abstract = {Water reservoirs, lakes, and larger basins, including their drainage areas, represent sedimentologically closed to semi-closed denudation-accumulation systems. The mean rates of mechanical denudation, DRme, and clastic sedimentation, SRme, are related by the ratio of the drainage/lake area, Ad/Al. If the latter is known, DRme (or the specific sediment yield SY in t per km2/a) can be calculated from SRme, or vice versa. The best data for modern SY mainly come from the sediment fills of artificial reservoirs. Small drainage areas of mountainous regions show SY values up to two orders of magnitude higher than lowlands and approximately one order higher than larger regions of mixed relief. This is also true of arid to semi-arid zones which often provide approximately as much sediment (SY) as humid temperate and even tropical zones of comparable relief. Lithology and climate (river runoff) also may play some role for SY from catchments of limited size. The importance of these factors is exemplified by perialpine lakes and two East African lakes. Sediment yields gained from some large reservoirs compare well with long-term denudation rates derived from geological studies (e.g., the Tarbela dam reservoir along the Indus River). In many other cases, human activities have raised SY by factors of 2\textendash 10, locally up to {$>$}100. Artificial reservoirs in mountainous regions with SY in the range of 300\textendash 2000\hspace{0.25em}t\,per\,km2/a tend to become filled within several tens to hundreds of years; some have even shorter lifetimes. Perialpine lakes of the Alps and British Columbia are strongly affected by delta prograding and have lifetimes mostly between 15 and 40\hspace{0.25em}ka. Closed lake systems in deep morphological depressions (Lake Bonneville, Aral Sea, northern Caspian Sea) have a high potential for sediment storage up to the level of spillover and therefore can persist over long time periods. Basins with markedly subsiding basin floors (lakes of the East African rift zone, the southern Caspian Sea, and the Black Sea, both on oceanic crust) can survive for many Ma in the future, despite relatively high terrigenous input.},

In addition to accuracy, methods for estimating flood risk must be uniformly and consistently applied because management of the Nation's water and related land resources is a collaborative effort involving multiple actors including most levels of government and the private sector.Flood frequency guidelines have been published in the United States since 1967, and have undergone periodic revisions. In 1967, the U.S. Water Resources Council presented a coherent approach to flood frequency with Bulletin 15, ``A Uniform Technique for Determining Flood Flow Frequencies.'' The method it recommended involved fitting the log-Pearson Type III distribution to annual peak flow data by the method of moments.The first extension and update of Bulletin 15 was published in 1976 as Bulletin 17, ``Guidelines for Determining Flood Flow Frequency'' (Guidelines). It extended the Bulletin 15 procedures by introducing methods for dealing with outliers, historical flood information, and regional skew. Bulletin 17A was published the following year to clarify the computation of weighted skew. The next revision of the Bulletin, the Bulletin 17B, provided a host of improvements and new techniques designed to address situations that often arise in practice, including better methods for estimating and using regional skew, weighting station and regional skew, detection of outliers, and use of the conditional probability adjustment.The current version of these Guidelines are presented in this document, denoted Bulletin 17C. It incorporates changes motivated by four of the items listed as ``Future Work'' in Bulletin 17B and 30 years of post-17B research on flood processes and statistical methods. The updates include: adoption of a generalized representation of flood data that allows for interval and censored data types; a new method, called the Expected Moments Algorithm, which extends the method of moments so that it can accommodate interval data; a generalized approach to identification of low outliers in flood data; and an improved method for computing confidence intervals.Federal agencies are requested to use these Guidelines in all planning activities involving water and related land resources. State, local, and private organizations are encouraged to use these Guidelines to assure uniformity in the flood frequency estimates that all agencies concerned with flood risk should use for Federal planning decisions.This revision is adopted with the knowledge and understanding that review of these procedures will be ongoing. Updated methods will be adopted when warranted by experience and by examination and testing of new techniques.},

  abstract = {. Regional landslide susceptibility assessments pose complex problems. To solve these problems, numerous approaches, such as statistical analysis, geotechnical engineering approach, geomorphologic approach and fuzzy logic, have been employed. However, all the available methods for regional landslide susceptibility assessments have some uncertainties due to a lack of knowledge and variability. Minimizing these uncertainties provides realistic approaches. Use of the fuzzy logic approach to produce a landslide susceptibility map of a landslide-prone area in NW Turkey is the main purpose of the present study. For this purpose, the study includes five main stages, these being the preparation of a landslide inventory of the study area, the application of factor analysis, the extraction of fuzzy if-then rules, the use of a geographical information system, and the control of the reliability of the resulting landslide susceptibility map. Slope angle, slope aspect, land use, weathering depth, water conditions and topographical elevation were considered as landslide conditioning factors for the study area. A total of 23 if-then rules was extracted from the field data. Employing these rules, fuzzified index maps representing each parameter were obtained. Finally, combining these maps, the landslide susceptibility map of the area was prepared. When compared with the landslide susceptibility map, the landslides identified in the area were found to be located in the very high- and high-susceptibility zones. As far as the performance of the fuzzy approach for processing is concerned, the images appear to be quite satisfactory, the zones determined on the map being zones of relative susceptibility.},

  abstract = {Preparation of landslide susceptibility maps is important for engineering geologists and geomorphologists. However, due to complex nature of landslides, producing a reliable susceptibility map is not easy. For this reason, many procedures have been used to produce such maps. In this study, a new attempt is tried to produce landslide susceptibility map of a part of West Black Sea Region of Turkey. To obtain the fuzzy relations for producing the susceptibility map, a landslide inventory database is compiled by both field surveys and airphoto studies. A total of 266 landslides are identified in the study area, and dominant mode of failure is rotational slide while the other mode of failures are soil flow and shallow translational slide. The landslide inventory and the parameter maps are analyzed together using a computer program (FULLSA) developed in this study. The computer program utilizes the fuzzy relations and produces the landslide susceptibility map automatically. According to this map, 9.6\% of the study area is classified as very high susceptibility, 10.3\% as high susceptibility, 8.9\% as moderate susceptibility, 27.5\% as low susceptibility and 43.8\% as very low susceptibility or nonsusceptible areas. The prediction performance of the susceptibility map is checked by considering actual landslides in the study area. For this purpose, strength of the relation (rij) and the root mean square error (RMSE) values are calculated as 0.867 and 0.284, respectively. These values show that the produced landslide susceptibility map in the present study has a sufficient reliability. It is believed that the approach employed in this study mainly prevents the subjectivity sourced from the parameter selection and provides a support to improve the landslide susceptibility mapping studies.},

Assessing the hazard they pose and what drives their movement in the years following the mainshock has not yet been attempted, primarily because multitemporal landslide inventories are lacking. By exploiting a multitemporal inventory (2005\textendash 2018) covering the epicentral region of the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake and a set of conditioning factors (seismic, topographic, and hydrological), we perform statistical tests to understand the temporal evolution of these factors affecting debris remobilizations. Our analyses, supported by a random-forest susceptibility assessment model, reveal a prediction capability of seismicrelated variables declining with time, as opposed to hydro-topographic parameters gaining importance and becoming predominant within a decade. These results may have important implications on the way conventional susceptibility/hazard assessment models should be employed in areas where coseismic landslides are the main sediment production mechanism on slopes.},

Twenty independent variables were used as predictors, including lithology as a categorical variable.

The model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) statistic.

  abstract = {Landslide damages are one of the most costly natural disasters in the United States. A recent estimate of the total annual cost of landslide damage is in excess of \$1 billion \{Schuster, 1978\}. The damages can be significantly reduced, however, through the combined action of technical experts, government, and the public. Before they can be expected to take action, local governments need to have an appreciation of costs of damage in their areas of responsibility and of the reductions in losses that can be achieved. Where studies of cost of landslide damages have been conducted, it is apparent that \{1\} costs to the public and private sectors of our economy due to landslide damage are much larger than anticipated; \{2\} taxpayers and public officials generally are unaware of the magnitude of the cost, owing perhaps to the lack of any centralization of data; and \{3\} incomplete records and unavailability of records result in lower reported costs than actually were incurred. The U.S. Geological Survey has developed a method to estimate the cost of landslide damages in regional and local areas and has applied the method in three urban areas and one rural area. Costs are for different periods and are unadjusted for inflation; therefore, strict comparisons of data from different years should be avoided. Estimates of the average annual cost of landslide damage for the urban areas studied are \$5,900,000 in the San Francisco Bay area; \$4,000,000 in Allegheny County, Pa.; and \$5,170,000 in Hamilton County, Ohio. Adjusting these figures for the population of each area, the annual cost of damages per capita are \$1.30 in the nine-county San Francisco Bay region; \$2.50 in Allegheny County, Pa.; and \$5.80 in Hamilton County, Ohio. On the basis of data from other sources, the estimated annual damages on a per capita basis for the City of Los Angeles, Calif., are about \$1.60. If the costs were available for the damages from landslides in Los Angeles in 1977-78 and 1979-80, the annual per capita costs probably would be much larger. The landslide near the rural community of Manti, Utah, caused an expenditure of about \$1,800,000 or about \$1,000 per person during the period 1974-76. Because a recurrence for such a landslide cannot be established, it is not possible to develop a meaningful estimate of annual per capita damages. Communities are urged to examine their costs of landslide damage and to evaluate the feasibility of several alternative programs that, for a modest investment, could significantly reduce these losses.},

The area is undergoing rapid urban development, with slope instability causing a widespread natural hazard. Landslide-related parameters were largely estimated through image processing and visual interpretation of ASTER multi-spectral and topographic data. We used field measurements to define the quantification for three parameters: (a) slope angle in relation to lithology; (b) distance to drainage network in relation to stream order; and (c) distance to tectonic lineament in relation to lineament length. We employed a multi-parameter elimination and characterization model, based on estimation of the geometric mean, to remove areas where landslides are not expected to occur, and classify the remaining areas into landslide hazard categories. Our results show increased landslide hazard in and around Wushan and Badong Towns, as well as other populated areas along the Yangtze and its tributaries. We used field data on landslide distribution to identify typical geomorphological settings for different landslide types, and to provide ground control for the hazard assessment. The results indicate good correlation between classified high-hazard areas and field-confirmed slope failures, and show the usefulness of ASTER imagery for landslide hazard assessment at a regional scale.},

The key development here is the establishment of a model that integrates land instability with several factors that can relate hazard to human life, such as slope failures occurring in proximity to built-up areas and roads, and areas of high landslide risk along the bank of Yangtze and its major tributaries. The method correctly identifies some of the known destructive landslides in the region, like Qianjiangping and Huangtupo, as belonging to areas of potentially high landslide impact. Our results suggest that several population centres, including the towns of Wushan and Badong, are rated at high landslide hazard levels. This study highlights the importance of differentiating between landslide types within susceptibility assessment, and identifies those locations in the Three Gorges where the probability of landslide occurrence with negative impact to life and property is greatest.},

  abstract = {Landslides are a ubiquitous hazard in terrestrial environments with slopes, incurring human fatalities in urban settlements, along transport corridors and at sites of rural industry. Assessment of landslide risk requires high-quality landslide databases. Recently, global landslide databases have shown the extent to which landslides impact on society and identified areas most at risk. Previous global analysis has focused on rainfall-triggered landslides over short {$\sim$} 5year observation periods. This paper presents spatiotemporal analysis of a global dataset of fatal non-seismic landslides, covering the period from January 2004 to December 2016. The data show that in total 55 997 people were killed in 4862 distinct landslide events. The spatial distribution of landslides is heterogeneous, with Asia representing the dominant geographical area. There are high levels of interannual variation in the occurrence of landslides. Although more active years coincide with recognised patterns of regional rainfall driven by climate anomalies, climate modes (such as El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillation) cannot yet be related to landsliding, requiring a landslide dataset of 30+ years. Our analysis demonstrates that landslide occurrence triggered by human activity is increasing, in particular in relation to construction, illegal mining and hill cutting. This supports notions that human disturbance may be more detrimental to future landslide incidence than climate.},

  abstract = {This paper reports the use of many-objective optimization for water distribution system (WDS) design or rehabilitation problems. The term many-objective optimization refers to optimization with four or more objectives. The increase in the number of objectives brings new challenges for both optimization and visualization. This study uses a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm termed the epsilon Nondominated Sorted Genetic Algorithm II ({$\epsilon$}-NSGAII) and interactive visual analytics to reveal and explore the tradeoffs for the Anytown network problem. The many-objective formulation focuses on a suite of six objectives, as follows: (1) capital cost, (2) operating cost, (3) hydraulic failure, (4) leakage, (5) water age, and (6) fire-fighting capacity. These six objectives are optimized based on decisions related to pipe sizing, tank siting, tank sizing, and pump scheduling under five different loading conditions. Solving the many-objective formulation reveals complex tradeoffs that would not be revealed in a lower-dimensional optimization problem. Visual analytics are used to explore these complex tradeoffs and identify solutions that simultaneously improve the overall WDS performance but with reduced capital and operating costs. This paper demonstrates that a many-objective visual analytics approach has clear advantages and benefits in supporting more informed, transparent decision-making in the WDS design process.

  abstract = {Shallow landslides are unforeseeable phenomena often resulting in critical conditions in terms of people's safety and damage. The main purpose of this paper is the comparison of different statistical methods used to determine the rainfall thresholds for the shallow landslide occurrence. Rainfall data over a 46-year period were collected for one rain gauge located in a test area of northwest Italy (Riviera Spezzina; RS). In the RS, intense rainfalls often induce shallow landslides causing damage and sometimes casualties. The rainfall events occurred in the 1967\textendash 2006 period were classified as events inducing shallow landslides (SLEs1967\textendash 2006) and events that did not trigger shallow landslides (NSLEs1967\textendash 2006). Thresholds for various percentiles of SLEs1967\textendash 2006 were computed by identifying the lower limit above which shallow landslides occurred. Another set of thresholds, corresponding to different probabilities of occurrence, was determined using SLEs1967\textendash 2006 and NSLEs1967\textendash 2006. The least-squares linear fit (LSF) and the quantile regression (QR) techniques were employed in the former approach, while the logistic regression (LR) was applied in the latter. The thresholds were validated with the same data used for their definition and with the data recorded in the 2008\textendash 2014 period. Contingency tables were created and contingencies and skill scores were computed. The 10\% probability threshold obtained using the LR method is characterized by the best values of at least two skill scores for both periods considered; therefore, it may be considered the ``best'' threshold for the RS. The results of this work can help the choice of the best statistical method to determine the shallow landslide rainfall thresholds.},

  abstract = {Warming of the Earth climate system is unequivocal. That climate changes affect the stability of natural and engineered slopes and have consequences on landslides, is also undisputable. Less clear is the type, extent, magnitude and direction of the changes in the stability conditions, and on the location, abundance, activity and frequency of landslides in response to the projected climate changes. Climate and landslides act at only partially overlapping spatial and temporal scales, complicating the evaluation of the climate impacts on landslides. We review the literature on landslide-climate studies, and find a bias in their geographical distribution, with large parts of the world not investigated. We recommend to fill the gap with new studies in Asia, South America, and Africa. We examine advantages and limits of the approaches adopted to evaluate the effects of climate variations on landslides, including prospective modelling and retrospective methods that use landslide and climate records. We consider changes in temperature, precipitation, wind and weather systems, and their direct and indirect effects on the stability of single slopes, and we use a probabilistic landslide hazard model to appraise regional landslide changes. Our review indicates that the modelling results of landslide-climate studies depend more on the emission scenarios, the Global Circulation Models, and the methods to downscale the climate variables, than on the description of the variables controlling slope processes. We advocate for constructing ensembles of projections based on a range of emissions scenarios, and to use carefully results from worst-case scenarios that may over/under-estimate landslide hazards and risk. We further advocate that uncertainties in the landslide projections must be quantified and communicated to decision makers and the public. We perform a preliminary global assessment of the future landslide impact, and we present a global map of the projected impact of climate change on landslide activity and abundance. Where global warming is expected to increase the frequency and intensity of severe rainfall events, a primary trigger of rapid-moving landslides that cause many landslide fatalities, we predict an increase in the number of people exposed to landslide risk. Finally, we give recommendations for landslide adaptation and risk reduction strategies in the framework of a warming climate.},

  abstract = {Debris flows and sediment-laden floods in the Transverse Ranges of southern California pose severe hazards to nearby communities and infrastructure. Frequent wildfires denude hillslopes and increase the likelihood of these hazardous events. Debris-retention basins protect communities and infrastructure from the impacts of debris flows and sediment-laden floods and also provide critical data for volumes of sediment deposited at watershed outlets. In this study, we supplement existing data for the volumes of sediment deposited at watershed outlets with newly acquired data to develop new empirical models for predicting volumes of sediment produced by watersheds located in the Transverse Ranges of southern California. The sediment volume data represent a broad sample of conditions found in Ventura, Los Angeles and San Bernardino Counties, California. The measured volumes of sediment, watershed morphology, distributions of burn severity within each watershed, the time since the most recent fire, triggering storm rainfall conditions, and engineering soil properties were analyzed using multiple linear regressions to develop two models. A ``long-term model'' was developed for predicting volumes of sediment deposited by both debris flows and floods at various times since the most recent fire from a database of volumes of sediment deposited by a combination of debris flows and sediment-laden floods with no time limit since the most recent fire (n=344). A subset of this database was used to develop an ``emergency assessment model'' for predicting volumes of sediment deposited by debris flows within two years of a fire (n=92). Prior to developing the models, 32 volumes of sediment, and related parameters for watershed morphology, burn severity and rainfall conditions were retained to independently validate the long-term model. Ten of these volumes of sediment were deposited by debris flows within two years of a fire and were used to validate the emergency assessment model. The models were validated by comparing predicted and measured volumes of sediment. These validations were also performed for previously developed models and identify that the models developed here best predict volumes of sediment for burned watersheds in comparison to previously developed models.},

For 56 basins in eight burned areas located in Colorado, Utah and California, debris-flow volumes were estimated by quantifying the amount of material eroded from the main channels in a basin. These data were used to represent debris flows generated from burned basins in different regions and underlain by different rock types. A series of multiple regression analyses indicated that the variables that are most strongly related to debris-flow volume are storm rainfall total, basin area burned at moderate and high severity and basin area with slopes greater or equal than 30\% gradient. An evaluation of the models created indicates that the best model to estimate potential wildfire-related debris-flow volumes can be expressed by the equation; ln debris flow volume (ln m 3) = 0.65(ln basin area with slopes greater than or equal to 30\% (ln km2)) + 0.86(basin area burned at moderate and high severity (km2))1/2 + 0.22(total storm rainfall (mm)) 1/2 + 6.46, R2 = 0.83, residual standard error = 0.90 .

Here, we describe refinements made to the 500-m global burned area mapping algorithm that were implemented in late 2016 as part of the MODIS Collection 6 (C6) land-product reprocessing. The updated algorithm improves upon the heritage Collection 5.1 (C5.1) MCD64A1 and MCD45A1 algorithms by offering significantly better detection of small burns, a modest reduction in burn-date temporal uncertainty, and a large reduction in the extent of unmapped areas. Comparison of the C6 and C5.1 MCD64A1 products for fifteen years (2002\textendash 2016) on a regional basis shows that the C6 product detects considerably more burned area globally (26\%) and in almost every region considered. The sole exception was in Boreal North America, where the mean annual area burned was 6\% lower for C6, primarily as a result of a large increase in the number of small lakes mapped (and subsequently masked) at high latitudes in the upstream C6 input data. With respect to temporal reporting accuracy, 44\% of the C6 MCD64A1 burned grid cells were detected on the same day as an active fire, and 68\% within 2 days, which represents a substantial reduction in temporal uncertainty compared to the C5.1 MCD64A1 and MCD45A1 products. In addition, an areal accuracy assessment of the C6 burned area product undertaken using high resolution burned area reference maps derived from 108 Landsat image pairs is reported.},

The PSO approach initially dealt with a single-objective function but has been extended to deal with multiobjectives in a form called multiobjective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO). The algorithm is modified to account for multiobjective problems by introducing the Pareto rank concept. The new MOPSO algorithm is tested on three case studies. Two test functions are used as the first case study to generate the true Pareto fronts. The approach is further tested for parameter estimation of a well-known conceptual rainfall-runoff model, the Sacramento soil moisture accounting model having 13 parameters, for which the results are very encouraging. We also tested the MOPSO algorithm to calibrate a three-parameter support vector machine model for soil moisture prediction.},

  abstract = {\textemdash Rainfall-triggered landslides constitute a serious hazard and an important geomorphic process in many parts of the world. Attempts have been made at various scales in a number of countries to investigate triggering conditions in order to identify patterns in behaviour and, ultimately, to define or calculate landslide-triggering rainfall thresholds. This study was carried out in three landslide-prone regions in the North Island of New Zealand. Regional landslide-triggering rainfall thresholds were calculated using an empirical ``Antecedent Daily Rainfall Model.'' In this model, first introduced by, triggering rainfall conditions are represented by a combination of rainfall occurring in a period before the event (antecedent rainfall) and rainfall on the day of the event. A physically-based decay coefficient is derived for each region from the recessional behaviour of storm hydrographs and is used to produce an index for antecedent rainfall. Statistical techniques are employed to obtain the thresholds which best separate the rainfall conditions associated with landslide occurrence from those of non-occurrence or a given probability of occurrence.The resultant regional models are able to represent the probability of occurrence of landsliding events on the basis of rainfall conditions. The calculated thresholds show regional differences in susceptibility of a given landscape to landslide-triggering rainfall. These differences relate to both the landslide database and the difference of existing physical conditions between the regions.},

We survey techniques for generating the spatial and temporal input data for such models and present an example using a transient deterministic model that combines an analytic solution to assess the pore-pressure response to rainfall infiltration with an infinite-slope stability calculation. Pore-pressures and factors of safety are computed on a cell-by-cell basis and can be displayed or manipulated in a grid-based GIS. Input data are high-resolution (1.8~m) topographic information derived from LiDAR data and simple descriptions of initial pore-pressure distribution and boundary conditions for a study area north of Seattle, Washington. Rainfall information is taken from a previously defined empirical rainfall intensity\textendash duration threshold and material strength and hydraulic properties were measured both in the field and laboratory. Results are tested by comparison with a shallow landslide inventory. Comparison of results with those from static infinite-slope stability analyses assuming fixed water-table heights shows that the spatial prediction of shallow landslide susceptibility is improved using the transient analyses; moreover, results can be depicted in terms of the rainfall intensity and duration known to trigger shallow landslides in the study area.},

  abstract = {The aim of the present study is to prepare a landslide susceptibility map of a region of about 120 km2, between G\"okcesu and Pazark\"oy (around Mengen, NW Turkey) at approximately 10 km north of the North Anatolian Fault Zone, where frequent landslides occur. For this purpose, mechanisms of the landslides were studied by two-dimensional stability analyses together with field observations, and the parameters controlling the development of such slides were identified. Field observations indicated that the failures generally developed within the unconsolidated and/or semiconsolidated soil units in forms of rotational, successive shallow landslides within the weathered zone in Mengen, Cukurca and Sazlar formations. Although consisting of residual soils, Capak and G\"okdag formations do not exhibit landslides as the natural slopes formed on these, do not exceed the critical slope angles. Statistical evaluations and distribution of the landslides on the topographical map showed that such parameters as cohesion, angle of internal friction, slope, relative height, orientation of slopes, proximity to drainage pattern, vegetation cover and proximity to major faults were the common features on the landslides. Digital images were obtained to represent all these parameters on gray scale on the SPOT image and on the digital elevation model (DEM) of the area using image processing techniques. Soil mechanics tests were carried out on 36 representative samples collected from different units, and parameters were determined for two-dimensional stability analyses basing on ``sensitivity approach'' and for the preparation of digital shear strength map. In order to determine the critical slope angle values for the residual soils, a series of sensitivity analyses were realized by using two-dimensional deterministic slope stability analyses techniques for varying values of cohesion, angle of internal friction and slope height along with varying saturation conditions. According to the results of the sensitivity analyses, the Mengen formation was found to be most susceptible unit to landslides, covering about 33.5\% of the region studied in terms of surface area. The distribution of the critical slopes were determined by superimposing the critical slope values from sensitivity analyses on slope map of the study area. On the other hand, iso-cohesion and iso-friction maps were produced by locating the values of cohesion and internal friction angles in a geographic coordinate system such that they coincide with sample locations on the DEM and by further interpolation of the values concerned. The pixel values were evaluated in gray scale from 0 to 255, 0 representing the lowest pixel value and 255 representing the highest. Sensitivity analyses on cohesion and angle of internal friction to investigate the effects of these parameters only on stability, revealed that cohesion was effective at a rate of 70\% by itself, while angle of internal friction alone controlled the stability by a rate of 30\%. The iso-cohesion and iso-friction maps previously obtained were digitally combined in these rates and a ``shear strength map'' was prepared. The geographic setting of the study area is such that northern slopes usually receive dense precipitation. In relation to this fact, about 42\% of the landslides are due north. Thus, a slope orientation map was prepared using the DEM, and slopes facing north were evaluated as being more susceptible to sliding. Proximity to the drainage pattern was another important factor in the evaluation, as streams could adversely affect the stability by either eroding the toe or saturating the slope, or both. When considered together, in conjunction with the field observations, faults and landslides showed a close association. In the area, about 88\% of the landslides were detected within an area closer than 250 m to major faults, therefore, a main discontinuity map was produced using the SPOT image of the region, and ``proximity to major faults'' was evaluated as a parameter as most of the landslides developed in areas where the vegetation was rather sparse. A vegetation cover map was therefore obtained from the SPOT image, and the areas with denser vegetation were considered to be less susceptible to sliding with respect to the areas with less or no vegetation. Having prepared the maps accounting for the distribution of critical slopes, shear strength properties, relative height, slope angle, orientation of the slopes, vegetation cover, proximity to the drainage pattern, geographic corrections were carried on each of these, and a potential failure map was obtained for the residual soils by superimposing all these maps. Next, a classification was performed on the final map and five relative zones of susceptibility were defined. When compared with this map, all of the landslides identified in the field were found to be located in the most susceptible zone. The performance of the method used in processing the images appears to be quite high, the zones determined on the map being the zones of relative susceptibility.},

An extensive landslide interpretation was carried out using a large set of optical high resolution satellite images (e.g. ASTER, ALOS, Cartosat-1, SPOT-5 and IKONOS) as well as air photos for both the pre- and post-earthquake situation. Landslide scarps were mapped as points using multi-temporal visual image interpretation taking into account shape, tone, texture, pattern, elevation and ridge and valley orientation. Nearly 60,000 individual landslide scarps were mapped. The landslide distribution map was compared with the inventory map that was prepared directly after the earthquake, which contains about 11,000 individual landslide points, through the calculation of normalized landslide isopleths maps. Remarkable differences were observed, as the earlier inventory mapping did not consider the pre-earthquake situation and did not consider all individual landslides. As part of the landslide inventory, landslides were identified that had blocked the drainage and had formed landslide dams. The landslide distribution was compared with a number of aspects, such as the seismic parameters (distance to epicenter, distance to fault rupture, co-seismic fault geometry and co-seismic slip distribution), and geology. The most remarkable correlation found was with the co-seismic slip distribution and the fault geometry. Landslide distribution in the section of the fault that had mainly a thrust component with low angle fault plane was found to be much higher than the sections that had steeper fault angles and a major strike slip component.},

  abstract = {A major goal in environmental modeling is identifying and quantifying sources of uncertainty in the modeling process. A forecast ensemble is developed in this study for a rainfall-runoff simulation system. This ensemble includes several quantitative precipitation estimates that serve as inputs to the Vflo\texttrademark{} hydrologic model. The rainfall estimates are derived from rain gauges, radar, satellite, and combinations, and their probability distribution is assumed to encompass the true, but unknown, rainfall. Sensitive model parameters in the model are also perturbed within their physical bounds to create a combined input-parameter ensemble. If all major sources of uncertainty are accounted for, then observations of river discharge should fall within simulation bounds. Otherwise, there may be additional errors that lie within the model structure. Probability distributions derived from the forecast ensemble encompass streamflow observations for three hydrologic events examined during October and December on the Blue River Basin in Oklahoma. It is discovered, however, that all simulations from an ensemble created for a warm season case overforecast discharge peaks and volumes. Climatological rain gauge, discharge, and soil moisture observations are introduced to illuminate the source of uncertainty that was not accounted for in the combined input-parameter ensemble. Observations show a strong correlation between dry, deep-layer soils and significantly reduced runoff production (provided the same rainfall inputs) during the summer months. The Green and Ampt methodology is used in the model to compute soil infiltration rates. Evidence suggests additional abstractions such as interception and evapotranspiration by vegetation and deep cracks in the soil structure contribute to enhanced infiltration rates during the warm season. These effects need to be considered for future infiltration models.},

  abstract = {Evaluation of maps generated from different conceptual models or data processing approaches at spatial level has importance in many geoenvironmental applications. This paper addresses the spatial comparison of different landslide susceptibility zonation (LSZ) raster maps of the same area derived from various procedures. In hilly regions such as the Himalayas, occurrence of landslides is frequent, which necessitates the study of landslides in the region for future developmental planning. A critical aspect in landslide studies is the procedure for assignment of weights to various causative factors affecting the occurrence of landslides. A detailed study on conventional, artificial neural network (ANN) black box, fuzzy set based and combined neural and fuzzy weighting procedures for LSZ mapping in the Himalayas has recently been published by the authors in [Kanungo, D.P., Arora, M.K., Sarkar, S., Gupta, R.P., 2006. A comparative study of conventional, ANN black box, fuzzy and combined neural and fuzzy weighting procedures for landslide susceptibility zonation in Darjeeling Himalayas. Engineering Geology 85, 347\textendash 366]. The evaluation of various maps in that study was however based only on comparison of areal extents of various landslide susceptibility zones. In this paper, we present a spatial level comparative evaluation of those maps to get a detailed insight into the performance of each of the weighting procedures for landslide susceptibility zonation. The evaluation has been done through three approaches, viz., landslide density analysis, error matrix analysis and difference image analysis. Based on the landslide density values, it is inferred that the combined neural and fuzzy procedure for LSZ mapping appears to be significantly better than other procedures. The error matrix analysis highlights the significant difference between the conventional subjective weight assignment procedure and the objective combined neural and fuzzy procedure. Finally, the significant influence of a causative factor has been revealed by difference image analysis. The use of these spatial evaluation approaches in tandem may be highly beneficial to quantitatively assess the landslide susceptibility zonation or any other such maps.},

  abstract = {Soil hydraulic properties (SHPs) regulate the movement of water in the soil. This in turn plays an important role in the water and energy cycles at the land surface. At present, SHPs are commonly defined by a simple pedotransfer function from soil texture class, but SHPs vary more within a texture class than between classes. To examine the impact of using soil texture class to predict SHPs, we run the Noah land surface model for a wide variety of measured SHPs. We find that across a range of vegetation cover (5\textendash 80\% cover) and climates (250\textendash 900 mm mean annual precipitation), soil texture class only explains 5\% of the variance expected from the real distribution of SHPs. We then show that modifying SHPs can drastically improve model performance. We compare two methods of estimating SHPs: (1) inverse modeling and (2) soil texture class. Compared to texture class, inverse modeling reduces errors between measured and modeled latent heat flux from 88 to 28 W/m2. Additionally we find that with increasing vegetation cover the importance of SHPs decreases and that the van Genuchten m parameter becomes less important, while the saturated conductivity becomes more important.},

  abstract = {Information relevant for most hydrologic applications cannot be obtained directly from the native-scale outputs of climate models. As a result the climate model output must be downscaled, often using statistical methods. The plethora of statistical downscaling methods requires end-users to make a selection. This work is intended to provide end-users with aid in making an informed selection. We assess four commonly used statistical downscaling methods: daily and monthly disaggregated-to-daily Bias Corrected Spatial Disaggregation (BCSDd, BCSDm), Asynchronous Regression (AR), and Bias Corrected Constructed Analog (BCCA) as applied to a continental-scale domain and a regional domain (BCCAr). These methods are applied to the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis, as a surrogate for a climate model, to downscale precipitation to a 12 km gridded observation data set. Skill is evaluated by comparing precipitation at daily, monthly, and annual temporal resolutions at individual grid cells and at aggregated scales. BCSDd and the BCCA methods overestimate wet day fraction, and underestimate extreme events. The AR method reproduces extreme events and wet day fraction well at the grid-cell scale, but over (under) estimates extreme events (wet day fraction) at aggregated scales. BCSDm reproduces extreme events and wet day fractions well at all space and time scales, but is limited to rescaling current weather patterns. In addition, we analyze the choice of calibration data set by looking at both a 12 km and a 6 km observational data set; the 6 km observed data set has more wet days and smaller extreme events than the 12 km product, the opposite of expected scaling.},

The landslide susceptibility model was obtained through discriminant analysis of 46 thematic environmental variables and using the presence of shallow landslides obtained from a multi-temporal inventory map as the dependent variable for statistical analysis. By comparing the number of correctly and incorrectly classified mapping units, it is established that the model classifies 77.0\% of 894 mapping units correctly. Model fitting performance is investigated by comparing the proportion of the study area in each probability class with the corresponding proportion of landslide area. We then prepare an ensemble of 350 landslide susceptibility models using the same landslide and thematic information but different numbers of mapping units. This ensemble is exploited to investigate the model reliability, including the role of the thematic variables used to construct the model, and the model sensitivity to changes in the input data. By studying the variation of the model's susceptibility estimate, the error associated with the susceptibility assessment for each mapping unit is determined. This result is shown on a map that complements the landslide susceptibility map. Prediction skill of the susceptibility model is then estimated by comparing the forecast with two recent event inventory maps. The susceptibility model is found capable of predicting the newly triggered landslides. A general framework for testing a susceptibility model is proposed, including a scheme for ranking the quality of the susceptibility assessment.},

Assuming that landslide recurrence will remain the same in the future, and adopting a Poisson probability model, we determine the exceedance probability of having one or more landslides in each mapping unit, for different periods. We obtain the probability of landslide size by analysing the frequency\textendash area statistics of landslides, obtained from the multi-temporal inventory map.

One-hundred-twenty-four empirical thresholds linking measurements of the event and the antecedent rainfall conditions to the occurrence of landslides are considered. We then describe a database of 853 rainfall events that resulted or did not result in landslides in the CADSES area. Rainfall and landslide information in the database was obtained from the literature; climate information was obtained from the global climate dataset compiled by the Climate Research Unit of the East Anglia University. We plot the intensity-duration values in logarithmic coordinates, and we establish that with increased rainfall duration the minimum intensity likely to trigger slope failures decreases linearly, in the range of durations from 20 minutes to {$\sim$}12 days. Based on this observation, we determine minimum intensity-duration (ID) and normalized-ID thresholds for the initiation of landslides in the CADSES area. Normalization is performed using two climatic indexes, the mean annual precipitation (MAP) and the rainy-day-normal (RDN). Threshold curves are inferred from the available data using a Bayesian statistical technique. Analysing the obtained thresholds we establish that lower average rainfall intensity is required to initiate landslides in an area with a mountain climate, than in an area characterized by a Mediterranean climate. We further suggest that for rainfall periods exceeding {$\sim$}12 days landslides are triggered by factors not considered by the ID model. The obtained thresholds can be used in operation landslide warning systems, where more accurate local or regional thresholds are not available.},

  abstract = {Worldwide, landslides incur catastrophic and significant economic and human losses. Previous studies have characterized the patterns in landslides' fatalities, from all kinds of triggering causes, at a continental or global scale, but they were based on data from periods of {$<$}10 years. The research herein presented hypothesizes that climate change associated with extreme rainfall and population distribution is contributing to a higher number of deadly landslides worldwide. This study maps and identified deadly landslides in 128 countries and it encompasses their role, for a 20 years' period from January/1995 to December/2014, considered representative for establishing a relationship between landslides and their meteorological triggers. A database of georeferenced landslides, their date, and casualties' information, duly validated, was implemented. A hot spot analysis for the daily record of landslide locations was performed, as well as a percentile-based approach to evaluate the trend of extreme rainfall events for each occurrence. The relationship between casualty, population distribution, and rainfall was also evaluated. For 20 years, 3876 landslides caused a total of 163,658 deaths and 11,689 injuries globally. They occurred most frequently between June and December in the Northern Hemisphere, and between December and February in the Southern Hemisphere. A significant global rise in the number of deadly landslides and hotspots across the studied period was observed. Analysis of daily rainfall confirmed that more than half of the events were in areas exposed to the risk of extreme rainfall. The relationships established between extreme rainfall, population distribution, seasonality, and landslides provide a useful basis for efforts to model the adverse impacts of extreme rainfall due to climate change and human activities and thus contribute towards a more resilient society.},

An ideal inventory would cover the entire area affected by an earthquake and include all of the landslides that are possible to detect down to sizes of 1\textendash 5m in length. The landslides must also be located accurately and mapped as polygons depicting their true shapes. Such mapped landslide distributions can then be used to perform seismic landslide hazard analysis and other quantitative analyses. Detailed inventory maps of landslide triggered by earthquakes began in the early 1960s with the use of aerial photography. In recent years, advances in technology have resulted in the accessibility of satellite imagery with sufficiently high resolution to identify and map all but the smallest of landslides triggered by a seismic event. With this ability to view any area of the globe, we can acquire imagery for any earthquake that triggers significant numbers of landslides. However, a common problem of incomplete coverage of the full distributions of landslides has emerged along with the advent of high resolution satellite imagery.},

  abstract = {Future climate projections of Global Climate Models (GCMs) under different emission scenarios are usually used for developing climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies. However, the existing GCMs have only limited ability to simulate the complex and local climate features, such as precipitation. Furthermore, the outputs provided by GCMs are too coarse to be useful in hydrologic impact assessment models, as these models require information at much finer scales. Therefore, downscaling of GCM outputs is usually employed to provide fine-resolution information required for impact models. Among the downscaling techniques based on statistical principles, multiple regression and weather generator are considered to be more popular, as they are computationally less demanding than the other downscaling techniques. In the present study, the performances of a multiple regression model (called SDSM) and a weather generator (called LARS-WG) are evaluated in terms of their ability to simulate the frequency of extreme precipitation events of current climate and downscaling of future extreme events. Areal average daily precipitation data of the Clutha watershed located in South Island, New Zealand, are used as baseline data in the analysis. Precipitation frequency analysis is performed by fitting the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution to the observed, the SDSM simulated/downscaled, and the LARS-WG simulated/downscaled annual maximum (AM) series. The computations are performed for five return periods: 10-, 20-, 40-, 50- and 100-year. The present results illustrate that both models have similar and good ability to simulate the extreme precipitation events and, thus, can be adopted with confidence for climate change impact studies of this nature.},

We conduct a comparison of six high-resolution, daily and monthly gridded precipitation datasets over the Western United States. We compare the long-term average spatial patterns, and interannual variability of water-year total precipitation, as well as multi-year trends in precipitation across the datasets. We find that the greatest absolute differences among datasets occur in high-elevation areas and in the maritime mountain ranges of the Western United States, while the greatest percent differences among datasets relative to annual total precipitation occur in arid and rain-shadowed areas. Differences between datasets in some high-elevation areas exceed 200mmyr-1 on average, and relative differences range from 5 to 60\% across the Western United States. In areas of high topographic relief, true uncertainties and biases are likely higher than the differences among the datasets; we present evidence of this based on streamflow observations. Precipitation trends in the datasets differ in magnitude and sign at smaller scales, and are sensitive to how temporal inhomogeneities in the underlying precipitation gauge data are handled.},

This framework includes three major components: (1) a landslide susceptibility information database, including geology, elevation, topography, soil, and land-cover types; (2) a real-time space-borne precipitation estimation system (http://trmm.gsfc.nasa.gov); and (3) a near-real-time ground-shaking prediction system after earthquakes (http://earthquake.usgs.gov/eqcenter/shakemap/). The ultimate goal of this framework is to rapidly predict landslide potential after large earthquakes and/or heavy rainfall by combing the dynamic triggers with landslide susceptibility information derived from high-resolution geospatial datasets. However, the challenge for integrating these real-time systems into an operational landslide prediction network and quickly disseminating alerts around the world is tremendous. It requires continued efforts and interdisciplinary collaboration in the next 2\textendash 5 years in order to realize such a system, providing early warning for landslides around the globe in a day-to-day decision-making operation.},

In recent years, through the availability of remotely sensed datasets, it has become possible to conduct global-scale landslide hazard assessment. This paper evaluates the potential of the real-time NASA TRMM-based Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) system to advance our understanding of, and predictive ability for, rainfall-triggered landslides. Early results show that the landslide occurrences are closely associated with the spatial patterns and temporal distribution of rainfall characteristics. Particularly, the number of landslide occurrences and the relative importance of rainfall in triggering landslides rely on the influence of rainfall attributes (e.g. rainfall climatology, antecedent rainfall accumulation, and intensity-duration of rainstorms). TMPA precipitation data are available in both real-time and post-real-time versions, which are useful to assess the location and timing of rainfall-triggered landslide hazards by monitoring landslide-prone areas while receiving heavy rainfall. For the purpose of identifying rainfall-triggered landslides, an empirical global rainfall intensity-duration threshold is developed by examining a number of landslide occurrences and their corresponding TMPA precipitation characteristics across the world. These early results, in combination with TRMM real-time precipitation estimation system, may form a starting point for developing an operational early warning system for rainfall-triggered landslides around the globe.},

Relying on the recent advances in satellite remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) techniques, this paper aims to map landslide susceptibility over most of the globe using a GIS-based weighted linear combination method. First, six relevant landslide-controlling factors are derived from geospatial remote sensing data and coded into a GIS system. Next, continuous susceptibility values from low to high are assigned to each of the six factors. Second, a continuous scale of a global landslide susceptibility index is derived using GIS weighted linear combination based on each factor's relative significance to the process of landslide occurrence (e.g., slope is the most important factor, soil types and soil texture are also primary-level parameters, while elevation, land cover types, and drainage density are secondary in importance). Finally, the continuous index map is further classified into six susceptibility categories. Results show the hot spots of landslide-prone regions include the Pacific Rim, the Himalayas and South Asia, Rocky Mountains, Appalachian Mountains, Alps, and parts of the Middle East and Africa. India, China, Nepal, Japan, the USA, and Peru are shown to have landslide-prone areas. This first-cut global landslide susceptibility map forms a starting point to provide a global view of landslide risks and may be used in conjunction with satellite-based precipitation information to potentially detect areas with significant landslide potential due to heavy rainfall.},

The first phase represents times of redistribution and low infiltration, which does not generate preferential flow. Times of heavy infiltration, inducing preferential flow, are handled by the second phase. The Richards equation is applied as the governing flow equation for both phases and preferential flow is allowed for by increasing the hydraulic conductivity of the soil during the second phase. The parameters of the model were estimated by use of different techniques, including a transient field experiment and the subsequent solution of the inverse problem. The model was tested and a reasonably good agreement between simulated and experimental data was obtained. When long-term effects of preferential flow, rather than an event-specific representation of the involved processes are in focus, the presented model seems to be an adequate approach. More specific parameter estimation techniques are a possibility to further improve the applicability of the model.},

Recent advances in satellite-based optical remote sensors have promoted the field of sensing surface water to a new era. This paper reviews the current status of detecting, extracting and monitoring surface water using optical remote sensing, especially progress in the last decade. It also discusses the current status and challenges in this field, including spatio-temporal scale issues, integration with in situ hydrological data and elevation data, obscuration caused by clouds and vegetation, and the growing need to map surface water at a global scale. Historically, sensors have exhibited a contradiction in resolutions. Techniques including pixel unmixing and reconstruction, and spatio-temporal fusion have been developed to alleviate this contradiction. Spatio-temporal dynamics of surface water have been modeled by combining remote sensing data with in situ river flow. Recent studies have also demonstrated that the river discharge can be estimated using only optical remote sensing imagery, providing valuable information for hydrological studies in ungauged areas. Another historical issue for optical sensors has been obscuration by clouds and vegetation. An effective approach of reducing this limitation is to combine with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data have also been employed to eliminate cloud/terrain shadows. The development of big data and cloud computation techniques make the increasing demand of monitoring global water dynamics at high resolutions easier to achieve. An integrated use of multi-source data is the future direction for improved global and regional water monitoring.},

However, studying such phenomena with traditional simulation methods is made difficult by their complex fluidization characteristics.

Compared with conventional methods, the proposed SPH modeling technique is the combination of a Bingham flow model and Navier\textendash Stokes equations in the framework of computational fluid dynamics. At first, two benchmark problems of dam break and granular flow are simulated and verified to evaluate the accuracy of the SPH model. Then, run-out analyses are performed for flow-like landslides triggered by the Ms 8.0 Wenchuan earthquake that occurred on 12 May 2008 in Sichuan Province, China. Run-out analyses of the Tangjiashan, Wangjiayan, and Donghekou landslides are conducted by the application of SPH models to real flow-like landslides. All simulations show good agreement with characteristics of flow-like landslides observed in the field. We have found that numerical modeling can capture the fundamental dynamic behavior of these flow-like landslides and produce preliminary results for hazard assessment and site selection for reconstruction in earthquake-prone areas.},

  abstract = {Field observations, laboratory experiments, and theoretical analyses indicate that landslides mobilize to form debris flows by three processes: (a) widespread Coulomb failure within a sloping soil, rock, or sediment mass, (b) partial or complete liquefaction of the mass by high pore-fluid pressures, and (c) conversion of landslide translational energy to internal vibrational energy (i.e. granular temperature). These processes can operate independently, but in many circumstances they appear to operate simultaneously and synergistically. Early work on debris-flow mobilization described a similar interplay of processes but relied on mechanical models in which debris behavior was assumed to be fixed and governed by a Bingham or Bagnold rheology. In contrast, this review emphasizes models in which debris behavior evolves in response to changing pore pressures and granular temperatures. One-dimensional infinite-slope models provide insight by quantifying how pore pressures and granular temperatures can influence the transition from Coulomb failure to liquefaction. Analyses of multidimensional experiments reveal complications ignored in one-dimensional models and demonstrate that debris-flow mobilization may occur by at least two distinct modes in the field.},

  abstract = {Landslides reflect landscape instability that evolves over meteorological and geological timescales, and they also pose threats to people, property, and the environment. The severity of these threats depends largely on landslide speed and travel distance, which are collectively described as landslide ``mobility''. To investigate causes and effects of mobility, we focus on a disastrous landslide that occurred on 22 March 2014 near Oso, Washington, USA, following a long period of abnormally wet weather. The landslide's impacts were severe because its mobility exceeded that of prior historical landslides at the site, and also exceeded that of comparable landslides elsewhere. The {$\sim$}8\texttimes 106~m3 landslide originated on a gently sloping ({$<$}20\textdegree ) riverside bluff only 180 m high, yet it traveled across the entire {$\sim$}1 km breadth of the adjacent floodplain and spread laterally a similar distance. Seismological evidence indicates that high-speed, flowing motion of the landslide began after about 50 s of preliminary slope movement, and observational evidence supports the hypothesis that the high mobility of the landslide resulted from liquefaction of water-saturated sediment at its base. Numerical simulation of the event using a newly developed model indicates that liquefaction and high mobility can be attributed to compression- and/or shear-induced sediment contraction that was strongly dependent on initial conditions. An alternative numerical simulation indicates that the landslide would have been far less mobile if its initial porosity and water content had been only slightly lower. Sensitive dependence of landslide mobility on initial conditions has broad implications for assessment of landslide hazards.},

  abstract = {A new mathematical model clarifies how diverse styles and rates of landslide motion can result from regulation of Coulomb friction by dilation or contraction of water-saturated basal shear zones. Normalization of the model equations shows that feedback due to coupling between landslide motion, shear zone volume change, and pore pressure change depends on a single dimensionless parameter {$\alpha$}, which, in turn, depends on the dilatancy angle {$\psi$} and the intrinsic timescales for pore pressure generation and dissipation. If shear zone soil contracts during slope failure, then {$\alpha$} {$<$} 0, and positive pore pressure feedback and runaway acceleration are inevitable. If the shear zone dilates, then {$\alpha$} {$>$} 0, and negative feedback permits slow, steady landslide motion to occur while positive pore pressure is supplied by rain infiltration. Steady state slip velocities v0 obey v0 = -(K/{$\psi$}) p*e, where K is the hydraulic conductivity and p*e is the normalized (dimensionless) negative pore pressure generated by dilation. If rain infiltration and attendant pore pressure growth continue unabated, however, their influence ultimately overwhelms the stabilizing influence of negative p*e. Then, unbounded landslide acceleration occurs, accentuated by an instability that develops if {$\psi$} diminishes as landslide motion proceeds. Nonetheless, numerical solutions of the model equations show that slow, nearly steady motion of a clay-rich landslide may persist for many months as a result of negative pore pressure feedback that regulates basal Coulomb friction. Similarly stabilized motion is less likely to occur in sand-rich landslides that are characterized by weaker negative feedback.},

The study areas include the Izumozaki (1961 and 2004 heavy rainfalls), Niihama (2004 heavy rainfalls), Houfu (2009 heavy rainfalls), and Hanokidachi/Kurikoma-dam regions (the 2008M 7.2 Iwate\textendash Miyagi Nairiku earthquake). The study areas include 7,106 landslides in these five regions. We use two topographic attributes (the slope gradient and the Laplacian) calculated from DEMs in varying window sizes. The hit rates for statistical prediction of landslide cells through discriminant analyses are calculated using the two topographic attributes as explanatory variables, and the landslide inventory data as the dependent variable. In cases of surface failure, the hit rates are found to diminish when the window size of the topographic attributes is too large or too small, indicating that an optimal scale factor is key in assessing shallow landslides. The representative window sizes are approximately 30m for shallow landslides; the optimal window size may be directly related to the average size of landslides in each region. We also find a stark contrast between rainfall- and earthquake-induced landslides. Rainfall-induced landslides are always most common at a slope gradient of 30\textdegree, but the frequency of earthquake-induced landslides increases exponentially with slope gradient. We find that the Laplacian, i.e., the attributes of surface convexity and concavity, and the slope gradient are both important factors for rainfall-induced landslides, whereas earthquake-induced landslides are influenced mainly by slope steepness.},

These two quantities can be extracted from the precipitation regimes simulated by climate models. This makes such models an attractive tool for use in the investigation of the effect of global warming on landslide frequencies. In order to provide some measure of the reliability of models used to address the landslide question, the present-day simulation of the antecedent precipitation and short-term rainfall using the daily data from the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis model (CGCM) is compared to observations along the south coast of British Columbia. This evaluation showed that the model was reasonably successful in simulating statistics of the antecedent rainfall but was less successful in simulating the short-term rainfall. The monthly mean precipitation data from an ensemble of 19 of the world's global climate models were available to study potential changes in landslide frequencies with global warming. Most of the models were used to produce simulations with three scenarios with different levels of prescribed greenhouse gas concentrations during the twenty-first century. The changes in the antecedent precipitation were computed from the resulting monthly and seasonal means. In order to deal with models' suspected difficulties in simulating the short-term precipitation and lack of daily data, a statistical procedure was used to relate the short-term precipitation to the monthly means. The qualitative model results agree reasonably well, and when averaged over all models and the three scenarios, the change in the antecedent precipitation is predicted to be about 10\% and the change in the short-term precipitation about 6\%. Because the antecedent precipitation and the short-term precipitation contribute to the occurrence of landslides, the results of this study support the prediction of increased landslide frequency along the British Columbia south coast during the twenty-first century.},

  abstract = {Landslides triggered by rainfall are the cause of thousands of deaths worldwide every year. One possible approach to limit the socioeconomic consequences of such events is the development of climatic thresholds for landslide initiation. In this paper, we propose a method that incorporates antecedent rainfall and streamflow data to develop a landslide initiation threshold for the North Shore Mountains of Vancouver, British Columbia. Hydroclimatic data were gathered for 18 storms that triggered landslides and 18 storms that did not. Discriminant function analysis separated the landslide-triggering storms from those storms that did not trigger landslides and selected the most meaningful variables that allow this separation. Discriminant functions were also developed for the landslide-triggering and nonlandslide-triggering storms. The difference of the discriminant scores, {$\Delta$}CS, for both groups is a measure of landslide susceptibility during a storm. The variables identified that optimize the separation of the two storm groups are 4-week rainfall prior to a significant storm, 6-h rainfall during a storm, and the number of hours 1 m3/s discharge was exceeded at Mackay Creek during a storm. Three thresholds were identified. The Landslide Warning Threshold (LWT) is reached when {$\Delta$}CS is -1. The Conditional Landslide Initiation Threshold (CTLI) is reached when {$\Delta$}CS is zero, and it implies that landslides are likely if 4 mm/h rainfall intensity is exceeded at which point the Imminent Landslide Initiation Threshold (ITLI) is reached. The LWT allows time for the issuance of a landslide advisory and to move personnel out of hazardous areas. The methodology proposed in this paper can be transferred to other regions worldwide where type and quality of data are appropriate for this type of analysis.},

  abstract = {Although existing empirical studies of runoff generation in headwater catchments have provided evidence of runoff mechanisms, contributing sources and active flowpaths from forest catchments around the world, our understanding of how hydrologic and biological processes vary and aggregate in space within headwater systems remains poor. In this study, we examine the spatial patterns of storm runoff generation from eight small nested forest catchments ranging in size from 7 to 147ha, as a function of antecedent moisture conditions and catchment morphology. The catchments, located in the formerly glaciated terrain of Mont Saint-Hilaire, Quebec, Canada, are complex in both their topographic and subsurface characterization. Hydrologic response from the eight catchments shows a strong nonlinear change with antecedent moisture conditions consistent with the hypothesis of different `states-of-wetness'. With the transition from wet to dry conditions, local groundwater stores become depleted in some ephemeral catchments, variable source areas shrink and new-water delivered by shallow-subsurface stormflow and the transient development of perched water in valley-bottoms can account for much larger percentages of total runoff (up to 76\% of total runoff). For the five storm events, no consistent pattern in percent new-water delivery was observed. However, for the storms observed under dry conditions, larger magnitudes of new water were generated from the three largest catchments attributable to basin morphology, while storms observed under wet conditions exhibited no consistent pattern, with larger variability among the smaller catchments. The results presented here illustrate the complexity of influences of antecedent moisture conditions and catchment morphology on spatial patterns of runoff generation in headwater systems.},

This study updates earlier studies that have used the extreme precipitation index (EPI) to assess observations and goes further by using the EPI to evaluate available climate model simulations. An increasing trend over the CONUS was found in the EPI, with large differences among seven subregions of the United States. Median of CMIP5 simulations also finds an increasing trend in the EPI, but with a smaller magnitude than the observations. Model spread is large and in most cases bigger than the model signal itself. Statistically significant (95th confidence level) increasing trends in the observational-based EPI occur over the Midwest and Eastern regions, while most decreasing trends occur over Western regions. Some models give negative correlation coefficients relative to observations. However, some ensemble members, for most models, show correlation coefficients greater than 0.5. Projections of extreme precipitation event frequency, for representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios 4.5 and 8.5, show increasing trends over the CONUS. Both scenarios give a steady increase throughout the period but the RCP 4.5 signal is smaller in magnitude. Overall, the RCP scenarios show an increase across all regions with the exception of some variability between decades in some regions for RCP 4.5. For the CONUS model spread is smaller than the projected signal. Regional analyses show overall agreement among models of a future increase in extreme precipitation event frequency over most regions.},

  abstract = {Deleterious effects of urban stormwater are widely recognized. In several countries, regulations have been put into place to improve the conditions of receiving water bodies, but planning and engineering of stormwater control is typically carried out at smaller scales. Quantifying cumulative effectiveness of many stormwater control measures on a watershed scale is critical to understanding how small-scale practices translate to urban river health. We review 100 empirical and modelling studies of stormwater management effectiveness at the watershed scale in diverse physiographic settings. Effects of networks with stormwater control measures (SCMs) that promote infiltration and harvest have been more intensively studied than have detention-based SCM networks. Studies of peak flows and flow volumes are common, whereas baseflow, groundwater recharge, and evapotranspiration have received comparatively little attention. Export of nutrients and suspended sediments have been the primary water quality focus in the United States, whereas metals, particularly those associated with sediments, have received greater attention in Europe and Australia. Often, quantifying cumulative effects of stormwater management is complicated by needing to separate its signal from the signal of urbanization itself, innate watershed characteristics that lead to a range of hydrologic and water quality responses, and the varying functions of multiple types of SCMs. Biases in geographic distribution of study areas, and size and impervious surface cover of watersheds studied also limit our understanding of responses. We propose hysteretic trajectories for how watershed function responds to increasing imperviousness and stormwater management. Even where impervious area is treated with SCMs, watershed function may not be restored to its predevelopment condition because of the lack of treatment of all stormwater generated from impervious surfaces; non-additive effects of individual SCMs; and persistence of urban effects beyond impervious surfaces. In most cases, pollutant load decreases largely result from run-off reductions rather than lowered solute or particulate concentrations. Understanding interactions between natural and built landscapes, including stormwater management strategies, is critical for successfully managing detrimental impacts of stormwater at the watershed scale.},

The region is prone to different types of slope deformation controlled by geological structure, physical and mechanical properties of materials, complicated hydrogeological setting, undulating morphology, and man-made influence. Taking into consideration the cause of the landslide, identified as groundwater change, two scenarios of landslide activity have been investigated. Scenario 1 considers the maximum groundwater level recorded from March 1995 to October 1998, corresponding to the period starting from the most recent landslide activity up to the end of remediation work. Scenario 2 considers the maximum groundwater level recorded from November 1998 to December 2004, after the remediation works, and corresponding to the actual situation of the landslide. It has been found from this study that slope angle has the highest influence on landslide instability in the Ve\v{l}k\'a \v{C}ausa landslide. Therefore, high resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is essential for obtaining reasonable results. In addition, an appropriate selection of the model input parameters (e.g., shear strength) is very important. The validation between the calculated landslide hazard zonation map and results of monitoring survey were examined. The results show moderate to good agreement with the inclinometric and geodetic measurements. It was also verified that the most active part of the landslide is the north-western side.},

All of these data sets have been digitized and rasterized at 10m grid spacing using ARC/INFO GIS software on a UNIX computer. Combining these data sets in a dynamic model based on Newmark's permanent-deformation (sliding-block) analysis yields estimates of coseismic landslide displacement in each grid cell from the Northridge earthquake. The modeled displacements are then compared with the digital inventory of landslides triggered by the Northridge earthquake to construct a probability curve relating predicted displacement to probability of failure. This probability function can be applied to predict and map the spatial variability in failure probability in any ground-shaking conditions of interest. We anticipate that this mapping procedure will be used to construct seismic landslide hazard maps that will assist in emergency preparedness planning and in making rational decisions regarding development and construction in areas susceptible to seismic slope failure.},

  abstract = {Landslide risk assessment (LRA) is a key component of landslide studies. The landslide risk can be defined as the potential for adverse consequences or loss to human population and property due to the occurrence of landslides. The LRA can be regional or site-specific in nature and is an important information for planning various developmental activities in the area. LRA is considered as a function of landslide potential (LP) and resource damage potential (RDP). The LP and RDP are typically characterized by the landslide susceptibility zonation map and the resource map (i.e., land use land cover map) of the area, respectively. Development of approaches for LRA has always been a challenge. In the present study, two approaches for LRA, one based on the concept of danger pixels and the other based on fuzzy set theory, have been developed and implemented to generate LRA maps of Darjeeling Himalayas, India. The LRA map based on the first approach indicates that 1,015 pixels of habitation and 921 pixels of road section are under risk due to landslides. The LRA map derived from fuzzy set theory based approach shows that a part of habitat area (2,496 pixels) is under very high risk due to landslides. Also, another part of habitat area and a portion of road network (7,204 pixels) are under high risk due to landslides. Thus, LRA map based on the concept of danger pixels gives the pixels under different resource categories at risk due to landslides whereas the LRA map based on the concept of fuzzy set theory further refines this result by defining the degree of severity of risk to these categories by putting these into high and low risk zones. Hence, the landslide risk assessment study carried out using two approaches in this paper can be considered in cohesion for assessing the risks due to landslides in a region.},

  abstract = {Majority of landslides in the Indian sub-continent are triggered by rainfall. Several attempts in the global scenario have been made to establish rainfall thresholds in terms of intensity-duration and antecedent rainfall models on global, regional and local scales for the occurrence of landslides. However, in the context of the Indian Himalayas, the rainfall thresholds for landslide occurrences are not yet understood fully. Neither on regional scale nor on local scale, establishing such rainfall thresholds for landslide occurrences in Indian Himalayas has yet been attempted. This paper presents an attempt towards deriving local rainfall thresholds for landslides based on daily rainfall data in and around Chamoli-Joshimath region of the Garhwal Himalayas, India. Around 128 landslides taken place in last 4 years from 2009 to 2012 have been studied to derive rainfall thresholds. Out of 128 landslides, however, rainfall events pertaining to 81 landslides were analysed to yield an empirical intensity\textendash duration threshold for landslide occurrences. The rainfall threshold relationship fitted to the lower boundary of the landslide triggering rainfall events is I = 1.82 D -0.23 (I = rainfall intensity in millimeters per hour and D = duration in hours). It is revealed that for rainfall events of shorter duration ({$\leq$}24 h) with a rainfall intensity of 0.87 mm/h, the risk of landslide occurrence in this part of the terrain is expected to be high. Also, the role of antecedent rainfall in causing landslides was analysed by considering daily rainfall at failure and different period cumulative rainfall prior to failure considering all 128 landslides. It is observed that a minimum 10-day antecedent rainfall of 55 mm and a 20-day antecedent rainfall of 185 mm are required for the initiation of landslides in this area. These rainfall thresholds presented in this paper may be improved with the hourly rainfall data vis-\`a-vis landslide occurrences and also data of later years. However, these thresholds may be used in landslide warning systems for this particular region of the Garhwal Himalayas to guide the traffic and provide safety to the tourists travelling along this pilgrim route during monsoon seasons.},

However, in contrast to single-hazard analyses, the examination of multiple hazards poses a range of additional challenges due to the differing characteristics of processes. This refers to the assessment of the hazard level, as well as to the vulnerability toward distinct processes, and to the arising risk level. As comparability of the single-hazard results is strongly needed, an equivalent approach has to be chosen that allows to estimate the overall hazard and consequent risk level as well as to rank threats. In addition, the visualization of a range of natural hazards or risks is a challenging task since the high quantity of information has to be depicted in a way that allows for easy and clear interpretation. The aim of this contribution is to give an outline of the challenges each step of a multi-hazard (risk) analysis poses and to present current studies and approaches that face these difficulties.},

This study focuses on the development of an accurate and efficient method of data integration, processing and generation of a landslide susceptibility map using an ANN and data from ASTER images. The method contains two major phases. The first phase is the data integration and analysis, and the second is the Artificial Neural Network training and mapping. The data integration and analysis phase involve GIS based statistical analysis relating landslide occurrence to geological and DEM (digital elevation model) derived geomorphological parameters. The parameters include slope, aspect, elevation, geology, density of geological boundaries and distance to the boundaries. This phase determines the geological and geomorphological factors that are significantly correlated with landslide occurrence. The second phase further relates the landslide susceptibility index to the important geological and geomorphological parameters identified in the first phase through ANN training. The trained ANN is then used to generate a landslide susceptibility map. Landslide data from the 2004 Niigata earthquake and a DEM derived from ASTER images were used. The area provided enough landslide data to check the efficiency and accuracy of the developed method. Based on the initial results of the experiment, the developed method is more than 90\% accurate in determining the probability of landslide occurrence in a particular area.},

  abstract = {Debris flows often occur in burned steeplands of southern California, sometimes causing property damage and loss of life. In an effort to better understand the hydrologic controls on post-fire debris-flow initiation, timing and magnitude, we measured the flow stage, rainfall, channel bed pore fluid pressure and hillslope soil-moisture accompanying 24 debris flows recorded in five different watersheds burned in the 2009 Station and Jesusita Fires (San Gabriel and Santa Ynez Mountains). The measurements show substantial differences in debris-flow dynamics between sites and between sequential events at the same site. Despite these differences, the timing and magnitude of all events were consistently associated with local peaks in short duration ({$<$} = 30 min) rainfall intensity. Overall, debris-flow stage was best cross-correlated with time series of 5-min rainfall intensity, and lagged the rainfall by an average of just 5 min. An index of debris-flow volume was also best correlated with short-duration rainfall intensity, but found to be poorly correlated with storm cumulative rainfall and hillslope soil water content. Post-event observations of erosion and slope stability modeling suggest that the debris flows initiated primarily by processes related to surface water runoff, rather than shallow landslides. By identifying the storm characteristics most closely associated with post-fire debris flows, these measurements provide valuable guidance for warning operations and important constraints for developing and testing models of post-fire debris flows.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Distributed catchment models are widely used tools for predicting hydrologic behavior. While distributed models require many parameters to describe a system, they are expected to simulate behavior that is more consistent with observed processes. However, obtaining a single set of acceptable parameters can be problematic, as parameter equifinality often results in several behavioral sets that fit observations (typically streamflow). In this study, we investigate the extent to which equifinality impacts a typical distributed modeling application. We outline a hierarchical approach to reduce the number of behavioral sets based on regional, observation-driven, and expert-knowledge-based constraints. For our application, we explore how each of these constraint classes reduced the number of behavioral parameter sets and altered distributions of spatiotemporal simulations, simulating a well-studied headwater catchment, Stringer Creek, Montana, using the distributed hydrology\textendash soil\textendash vegetation model (DHSVM). As a demonstrative exercise, we investigated model performance across 10 000~parameter sets. Constraints on regional signatures, the hydrograph, and two internal measurements of snow water equivalent time series reduced the number of behavioral parameter sets but still left a small number with similar goodness of fit. This subset was ultimately further reduced by incorporating pattern expectations of groundwater table depth across the catchment. Our results suggest that utilizing a hierarchical approach based on regional datasets, observations, and expert knowledge to identify behavioral parameter sets can reduce equifinality and bolster more careful application and simulation of spatiotemporal processes via distributed modeling at the catchment scale.},

  abstract = {Following the Painted Cave Fire of 25 June 1990 in Santa Barbara, California which burned 1214 ha, an emergency watershed protection plan was implemented consisting of stream clearing, grade stabilizers and construction of debris basins. Research was initiated focusing on hydrological response and channel morphology changes on two branches of Maria Ygnacio Creek, the main drainage of the burned area. Research results support the hypothesis that the response of small drainage basins in chaparral ecosystems to wildfire is complex and flushing of sediment by fluvial processes is more likely than by high magnitude debris flows. During the winter of 1990\textendash 1991, 35\textendash 66 cm of rainfall and intensities up to 10 cm per hour for a five-minute period were recorded with a seasonal total of 100\% of average (normal) rainfall (average=63 cm/year). During the winter of 1991\textendash 1992, 48\textendash 74 cm of rainfall and intensities up to 8 cm per hour were recorded with a seasonal total of 115\% of normal. Even though there was moderate rainfall on barren, saturated soils, no major debris flows occurred in burned areas. The winter of 1992\textendash 1993 recorded total precipitation of about 170\% of normal, annual average intensities were relatively low and again no debris flows were observed. The response to winter storms in the first three years following the fire was a moderate but spectacular flushing of sediment, most of which was derived from the hillslopes upstream of the debris basins. The first significant storm and stream flow of the 1990\textendash 1991 winter was transport-limited resulting in large volumes of sediment being deposited in the channel of Maria Ygnacio Creek; the second storm and stream flow was sediment-limited and the channel scoured. Debris basins trapped about 23 000 m3, the majority coming from the storm of 17\textendash 20 March 1991. Sediment transported downstream during the three winters following the fire and not trapped in the debris basins was eventually flushed to the estuarine reaches of the creeks below the burn area, where approximately 108 000 m3 accumulated. Changes in stream morphology following the fire were dramatic as pools filled with sediment which greatly smoothed longitudinal and cross-sectional profiles. Major changes in channel morphology occur following a fire as sediment derived from the hillslope is temporarily stored in channels within the burned area. However, this sediment may quickly move downstream of the burned region, where it may accumulate reducing channel capacity and increasing the flood hazard. Ecological consequences of wildfire to the riparian zone of streams in the chaparral environment are virtually unknown, but must be significant as the majority of sediment (particularly gravel necessary for fish and other aquatic organisms) entering the system does so in response to fires. \textcopyright{} 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Background. Mass ground movements (commonly referred to as `landslides') are common natural hazards that can have significant economic, social and health impacts. They occur as single events, or as clusters, and are often part of `disaster' chains, occurring secondary to, or acting as the precursor of other disaster events. Whilst there is a large body of literature on the engineering and geological aspects of landslides, the mortality and morbidity caused by landslides is less well documented. As far as we are aware, this is the first systematic review to examine the health impacts of landslides.,  Methods. The MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, SCOPUS databases and the Cochrane library were systematically searched to identify articles which considered the health impacts of landslides. Case studies, case series, primary research and systematic reviews were included. News reports, editorials and non-systematic reviews were excluded. Only articles in English were considered. The references of retrieved papers were searched to identify additional articles.,  Findings. 913 abstracts were reviewed and 143 full text articles selected for review. A total of 27 papers reporting research studies were included in the review (25 from initial search, 1 from review of references and 1 from personal correspondence). We found a limited number of studies on the physical health consequences of landslides. Only one study provided detail of the causes of mortality and morbidity in relation a landslide event. Landslides cause significant mental health impacts, in particular the prevalence of PTSD may be higher after landslides than other types of disaster, though these studies tend to be older with only 3 papers published in the last 5 years, with 2 being published 20 years ago, and diagnostic criteria have changed since they were produced.,  Discussion. We were disappointed at the small number of relevant studies, and the generally poor documentation of the health impacts of landslides. Mental health impacts were better documented, though some of the studies are now quite old. Further research on the health impacts of landslides needs to be undertaken to support those responding to landslide disasters and to aid disaster risk mitigation advocacy.},

  abstract = {The measurement of global precipitation, both rainfall and snowfall, is critical to a wide range of users and applications. Rain gauges are indispensable in the measurement of precipitation, remaining the de facto standard for precipitation information across the Earth's surface for hydro-meteorological purposes. However, their distribution across the globe is limited: over land their distribution and density is variable, while over oceans very few gauges exist and where measurements are made, they may not adequately reflect the rainfall amounts of the broader area. Critically, the number of gauges available, or appropriate for a particular study, varies greatly across the Earth due to temporal sampling resolutions, periods of operation, data latency and data access. Numbers of gauges range from a few thousand available in near real time, to about a hundred thousand for all `official' gauges, and to possibly hundreds of thousands if all possible gauges are included. Gauges routinely used in the generation of global precipitation products cover an equivalent area of between about 250 m2 and 3,000 m2. For comparison, the center circle of a soccer pitch or tennis court is about 260 m2. Although each gauge should represent more than just the gauge orifice, auto-correlation distances of precipitation vary greatly with regime and the integration period. Assuming each Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) -available gauge is independent and represents a surrounding area of 5 km radius, this represents only about 1\% of the Earth's surface. The situation is further confounded for snowfall which has a greater measurement uncertainty.},

Precipitation products include the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA), the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) morphing (CMORPH) technique, the CPC merged microwave technique, the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) blended technique, and the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN) technique. In addition, the Geosynchronous Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) precipitation index (GPI) and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) operational forecast model products are included for comparison. Surface reference data from the European radar network is used as ground truth, supported by the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) precipitation gauge analysis and gauge data over the United Kingdom. Measures of correlation, bias ratio, probability of detection, and false alarm ratio are used to evaluate the products. Results show that satellite products generally exhibit a seasonal cycle in correlation, bias ratio, probability of detection, and false alarm ratio, with poorer statistics during the winter. The ECMWF model also shows a seasonal cycle in the correlation, although the results are poorer during the summer, while the bias ratio, probability of detection, and false alarm ratio are consistent through all seasons. Importantly, all the satellite HRPPs underestimate precipitation over northwest Europe in all seasons.},

  abstract = {A landslide susceptibility assessment for \.Izmir city (Western Turkey), which is the third biggest city of Turkey, was performed by a logistic regression method. A database of landslide characteristics was prepared using detailed field surveys. The major landslides in the study area are generally observed in the field, dominated by weathered volcanics, and 39.63\% of the total landslide area is in this unit. The parameters of lithology, slope gradient, slope aspect, distance to drainage, distance to roads and distance to fault lines were used as variables in the logistic regression analysis. The effect of each parameter on landslide occurrence was assessed from the corresponding coefficients that appear in the logistic regression function. On the basis of the obtained coefficients, lithology plays the most important role in determining landslide occurrence and distribution. Slope gradient has a more significant effect than the other geomorphological parameters, such as slope aspect and distance to drainage. Using a predicted map of probability, the study area was classified into five categories of landslide susceptibility: very low, low, moderate, high and very high. Whereas 49.65\% of the total study area has very low susceptibility, very high susceptibility zones make up 11.69\% of the area.},

  abstract = {Summary Rainfall\textendash runoff simulations were conducted to estimate the characteristics of the steady-state infiltration rate into 1-m2 north- and south-facing hillslope plots burned by a wildfire in October 2003. Soil profiles in the plots consisted of a two-layer system composed of an ash on top of sandy mineral soil. Multiple rainfall rates (18.4\textendash 51.2mmh-1) were used during 14 short-duration (30min) and 2 long-duration simulations (2\textendash 4h). Steady state was reached in 7\textendash 26min. Observed spatially-averaged steady-state infiltration rates ranged from 18.2 to 23.8mmh-1 for north-facing and from 17.9 to 36.0mmh-1 for south-facing plots. Three different theoretical spatial distribution models of steady-state infiltration rate were fit to the measurements of rainfall rate and steady-state discharge to provided estimates of the spatial average (19.2\textendash 22.2mmh-1) and the coefficient of variation (0.11\textendash 0.40) of infiltration rates, overland flow contributing area (74\textendash 90\% of the plot area), and infiltration threshold (19.0\textendash 26mmh-1). Tensiometer measurements indicated a downward moving pressure wave and suggest that infiltration-excess overland flow is the runoff process on these burned hillslope with a two-layer system. Moreover, the results indicate that the ash layer is wettable, may restrict water flow into the underlying layer, and increase the infiltration threshold; whereas, the underlying mineral soil, though coarser, limits the infiltration rate. These results of the spatial variability of steady-state infiltration can be used to develop physically-based rainfall\textendash runoff models for burned areas with a two-layer soil system.},

  abstract = {The increasing availability of remotely sensed data offers a new opportunity to address landslide hazard assessment at larger spatial scales. A prototype global satellite-based landslide hazard algorithm has been developed to identify areas that may experience landslide activity. This system combines a calculation of static landslide susceptibility with satellite-derived rainfall estimates and uses a threshold approach to generate a set of `nowcasts' that classify potentially hazardous areas. A recent evaluation of this algorithm framework found that while this tool represents an important first step in larger-scale near real-time landslide hazard assessment efforts, it requires several modifications before it can be fully realized as an operational tool. This study draws upon a prior work's recommendations to develop a new approach for considering landslide susceptibility and hazard at the regional scale. This case study calculates a regional susceptibility map using remotely sensed and in situ information and a database of landslides triggered by Hurricane Mitch in 1998 over four countries in Central America. The susceptibility map is evaluated with a regional rainfall intensity\textendash duration triggering threshold and results are compared with the global algorithm framework for the same event. Evaluation of this regional system suggests that this empirically based approach provides one plausible way to approach some of the data and resolution issues identified in the global assessment. The presented methodology is straightforward to implement, improves upon the global approach, and allows for results to be transferable between regions. The results also highlight several remaining challenges, including the empirical nature of the algorithm framework and adequate information for algorithm validation. Conclusions suggest that integrating additional triggering factors such as soil moisture may help to improve algorithm performance accuracy. The regional algorithm scenario represents an important step forward in advancing regional and global-scale landslide hazard assessment.},

Previous landslide research has qualitatively estimated how patterns in landslide activity may change based on climate change scenarios. We present the first quantitative view of potential modulation in future landslide activity over the High Mountain Asia region leveraging a new landslide hazard model and precipitation data from satellite and Global Climate Model sources. In doing so, we find that the rate of increase in landslide activity at the end of the century is expected to be greatest over areas covered by current glaciers and glacial lakes, potentially exacerbating the impacts of cascading hazards on populations downstream. This work demonstrates the potential of Global Climate Models and satellite-based precipitation estimates to characterize landslide hazards at time scales affected by climate change.},

A preliminary global landslide hazard algorithm has been developed to estimate areas of potential landslide occurrence in near real-time by combining a calculation of landslide susceptibility with satellite derived rainfall estimates to forecast areas with increased potential for landslide conditions. This paper presents a stochastic methodology to compare this new, landslide hazard algorithm for rainfall-triggered landslides with a newly available inventory of global landslide events, in order to determine the predictive skill and limitations of such a global estimation technique. Additionally, we test the sensitivity of the global algorithm to its input observables, including precipitation, topography, land cover and soil variables. Our analysis indicates that the current algorithm is limited by issues related to both the surface-based susceptibility map and the temporal resolution of rainfall information, but shows skill in determining general geographic and seasonal distributions of landslides. We find that the global susceptibility model has inadequate performance in certain locations, due to improper weighting of surface observables in the susceptibility map. This suggests that the relative contributions of topographic slope and soil conditions to landslide susceptibility must be considered regionally. The current, initial forecast system, although showing some overall skill, must be improved considerably if it is to be used for hazard warning or detailed studies. Surface and remote sensing observations at higher spatial resolution, together with improved landslide event catalogues, are required if global landslide hazard forecasts are to become an operational reality.},

This primarily heuristic model provides the flexibility to test a range of different contributing variables and the capability to compare landslide inventories within the model framework that vary greatly in their size, spatiotemporal scope, and collection methods. We create a regional susceptibility map and evaluate its performance using receiver operating characteristics for both continuous and binned susceptibility values. This susceptibility map forms the basis for a near-real-time landslide hazard assessment system that couples susceptibility with rainfall and soil moisture triggers to estimate potential landslide activity at a regional scale.

  abstract = {Landslide susceptibility and hazard assessments in common use are applied to small regions, where high-resolution, in situ, observables are available. When approximated over larger areas, these analyses are often restricted by the absence of landslide inventories, complex or data-intensive methodologies, and surface observable data resolution and availability. As a result, few analyses have considered how landslide hazard assessment can be approximated and modeled at regional and global scales. The increasing availability of remotely sensed surface data and precipitation products presents the opportunity to explore how these small-scale investigations may be scaled up to larger areas. In this thesis, I seek to bridge the gap between site-specific and global landslide susceptibility, hazard and risk assessments by identifying potential modeling approaches and surface observable data that can be transferable over a variety of spatial scales. A preliminary satellite-based global algorithm provides the framework in which to evaluate how the landslide susceptibility and satellite derived rainfall estimates can forecast potential landslide conditions globally. An analysis of this algorithm using a newly developed global landslide inventory dataset suggests that forecasting errors are geographically variable due to improper weighting of surface observables, resolution of the current susceptibility map, and limitations in the availability of landslide inventory data. These methodological and data limitation issues can be more thoroughly assessed at the regional level, where I develop a new susceptibility map using pre-existing regional landslide inventory data and higher resolution surface observables. These analyses explore the scaling relationships and transferability of two methodologies and several surface data products from local to regional scales and indicate that simple bivariate modeling techniques can more effectively approximate susceptibility at regional scales compared to more popular and complex modeling methodologies. Data availability and resolution, particularly for geomorphologic information, landslide inventories, and rainfall extremes, remain limiting factors in affecting the accuracy of landslide susceptibility assessments at multiple spatial scales. However, this thesis provides evidence that integrating available surface observable and precipitation products can greatly enhance landslide susceptibility, hazard and risk assessments and provide the foundation for improving dynamic landslide hazard forecasting in the future.},

A Landslide Hazard Assessment for Situational Awareness (LHASA) model was developed to indicate potential landslide activity in near real-time. LHASA combines satellite-based precipitation estimates with a landslide susceptibility map derived from information on slope, geology, road networks, fault zones, and forest loss. Precipitation data from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission are used to identify rainfall conditions from the past 7 days. When rainfall is considered to be extreme and susceptibility values are moderate to very high, a ``nowcast'' is issued to indicate the times and places where landslides are more probable. When LHASA nowcasts were evaluated with a Global Landslide Catalog, the probability of detection (POD) ranged from 8\% to 60\%, depending on the evaluation period, precipitation product used, and the size of the spatial and temporal window considered around each landslide point. Applications of the LHASA system are also discussed, including how LHASA is used to estimate long-term trends in potential landslide activity at a nearly global scale and how it can be used as a tool to support disaster risk assessment. LHASA is intended to provide situational awareness of landslide hazards in near real-time, providing a flexible, open-source framework that can be adapted to other spatial and temporal scales based on data availability.},

As simply defined, a landslide is ``the movement of a mass of rock, earth or debris down a slope'' (Cruden 1991), with gravity and often water as well being the major driving factors of this geomorphic process (e.g., Sidle and Ochiai 2006; Lu and Godt 2013). The diversity of landslide types is large, ranging from slides in a strict sense to types of movement such as flows, falls, topples, spreads, and complex landslides, a combination of at least two of these movement types (cf. Varnes 1958, 1978; Nem\v{c}ok et al. 1972; Cruden and Varnes 1996; Dikau et al. 1996; Hungr et al. 2014).

  abstract = {The 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake triggered the catastrophic Tsaoling landslide in Taiwan. The geomorphological change measured from the data of the 1989 and 2000 aerial photos reveals that the scar and deposit volumes are about 0.126~km3 and 0.15~km3 respectively. The debris material ran over a distance of 1.6~km with 500~m descent in elevation. In this paper, we use the continuum model of hydraulic flow, SHALTOP2D, based on the equations of Bouchut and Westdickenberg to simulate numerically the landslide dynamics. When the mass is moving, the flow is assumed hydrostatic with a basal Coulomb friction. The best fit is obtained using the basal friction angle equal to 6\textdegree, the only parameter of the simulation, uniformly applied in the calculation domain. The landslide front reaches the Chinshui river valley, the foothill of the slope, within only about 25~s after initiation and the motion settles in about 113~s. The maximum speed is estimated 75~m/s. The spreading of the deposit agrees well with the field measurement.},

  abstract = {Shallow landslides and consequent debris flows are an increasing concern in the Western Ghats of Kerala, India. Their increased frequency has been associated with deforestation and unfavourable land-use practices in cultivated areas. In order to evaluate the influence of vegetation on shallow slope failures a physically based, dynamic and distributed hydrological model (STARWARS) coupled with a probabilistic slope stability model (PROBSTAB) was applied to the upper Tikovil River basin (55{$\cdot$}6 km2). It was tuned with the limited evidence of groundwater conditions during the monsoon season of 2005 and validated against observed landslide activity in the hydrological year 2001\textendash 2002. Given the data poor conditions in the region some modifications to the original model were in order, including the estimation of parameters on the basis of generalized information from secondary sources, pedo-transfer functions, empirical equations and satellite remote sensing data. Despite the poor input, the model captured the general temporal and spatial pattern of instability in the area. Sensitivity analysis proved root cohesion, soil depth and angle of internal friction as the most dominant parameters influencing slope stability. The results indicate the importance of root cohesion in maintaining stability and the critical role of the management of rubber plantations in this. Interception and evapotranspiration showed little influence on the development of failure conditions. The study also highlights the importance of high resolution digital terrain models for the accurate mechanistic prediction of shallow landslide initiation.

This tool will help develop, evaluate, select, and place BMP options in various watershed scales based on cost and effectiveness. The system is called the System for Urban Stormwater Treatment and Analysis INtegration (SUSTAIN). SUSTAIN has seven key components: framework manager, ArcGIS interface, watershed module, BMP module, optimization module, post-processor, and Microsoft Access database. They are integrated under a common ArcGIS platform. The completed Phase 1 work included a framework design with all major components in place. The ongoing Phase 2 work will expand the capabilities and functionalities of the system. In addition to describing the background of the SUSTAIN development and framework components, presented in this paper is a SUSTAIN's preprocessing tool to facilitate BMP selection and configuration. Also discussed are adopted simulation processes for watershed runoff computation and routing through BMPs; an approach to address dual objectives of pollution and flood control; optimization search algorithms; and a multi-tier optimization strategy to develop large watershed-scale solutions from information developed in small-scale watersheds. Finally in this paper, the issue of balancing computational efficiency during the optimization process with the process simulation details is described.},

Since the beginning of Quaternary, these processes have lead to the development of collapse and subsidence dolines with a wide range of sizes, which have significant economic impacts. To reduce economic impact and increase safety, a regional analysis of this phenomenon is needed for spatial management. Therefore, a probability map of dolines was developed using logistic regression and geographic information system (GIS) techniques. This paper covers the selection of input data, manipulation of data using the GIS technology, and the use of logistic regression to generate a doline probability map. The primary variable in the doline development in this area is geomorphology, represented by the location of endorheic areas and different terrace levels. Secondary variables are the presence of irrigation and the water table gradient.},

  abstract = {Landsliding in response to rainfall involves physical processes that operate on disparate timescales. Relationships between these timescales guide development of a mathematical model that uses reduced forms of Richards equation to evaluate effects of rainfall infiltration on landslide occurrence, timing, depth, and acceleration in diverse situations. The longest pertinent timescale is A/D0, where D0 is the maximum hydraulic diffusivity of the soil and A is the catchment area that potentially affects groundwater pressures at a prospective landslide slip surface location with areal coordinates x, y and depth H. Times greater than A/D0 are necessary for establishment of steady background water pressures that develop at (x, y, H) in response to rainfall averaged over periods that commonly range from days to many decades. These steady groundwater pressures influence the propensity for landsliding at (x, y, H), but they do not trigger slope failure. Failure results from rainfall over a typically shorter timescale H2/D0 associated with transient pore pressure transmission during and following storms. Commonly, this timescale ranges from minutes to months. The shortest timescale affecting landslide responses to rainfall is , where g is the magnitude of gravitational acceleration. Postfailure landslide motion occurs on this timescale, which indicates that the thinnest landslides accelerate most quickly if all other factors are constant. Effects of hydrologic processes on landslide processes across these diverse timescales are encapsulated by a response function, , which depends only on normalized time, t*. Use of R(t*) in conjunction with topographic data, rainfall intensity and duration information, an infinite-slope failure criterion, and Newton's second law predicts the timing, depth, and acceleration of rainfall-triggered landslides. Data from contrasting landslides that exhibit rapid, shallow motion and slow, deep-seated motion corroborate these predictions.},

However, the available information on landslides in the Xiaojiang watershed is still limited. We constructed the essential spatial database of landslides using the GIS techniques. The quantitative relationships between landslides and factors affecting landslides are established by the Certainty Factor model (CF). The affecting factors such as lithology, structure, slope angle, slope aspect, elevation and off-fault distance are recognized. By applying CF value integration and landslide zonation, the most significant affecting factors are selected. The widespread landslide activities in the Xiaojiang watershed are caused and triggered by heavy rain. A promising approach to modeling the spatial distribution of rainfall-triggered landslide is combining the mechanistic infinite slope stability model with a hydrological model. A model modified from Stability INdex Mapping (SINMAP) is used to prepare the landslide susceptibility maps for different rainfall conditions. Information on these maps could be useful for explaining the known existing landslide, making emergency decisions and relieving the efforts on the avoidance and mitigation of future landslide hazards.},

Landslide locations and landslide-related factors such as slope, curvature, soil texture, soil drainage, effective thickness, wood type, and wood diameter were used for analyzing landslide susceptibility. A probability method was used for calculating the rating of the relative importance of each factor class to landslide occurrence. For calculating the weight of the relative importance of each factor to landslide occurrence, an artificial neural network method was developed. Using these methods, the landslide susceptibility index (LSI) was calculated using the rating and weight, and a landslide susceptibility map was produced using the index. The results of the landslide susceptibility analysis, with and without weights, were confirmed from comparison with the landslide location data. The comparison result with weighting was better than the results without weighting. The calculated weight and rating can be used to landslide susceptibility mapping.},

We colocated triggering rainfall to landslides, developed distributions of triggering and nontriggering rainfall event properties, and determined rainfall thresholds and intensity-duration ID curves and validated their performance. The best predictive performance was obtained by the intensity-duration ID threshold curve, followed by peak daily intensity Imax and mean event intensity Imean. Event duration by itself had very low predictive power. A single country-wide threshold of Imax = 28 mm/d was extended into space by regionalization based on surface erodibility and local climate (mean daily precipitation). It was found that wetter local climate and lower erodibility led to significantly higher rainfall thresholds required to trigger landslides. However, we showed that the improvement in model performance due to regionalization was marginal and much lower than what can be achieved by having a high-quality landslide database. Reference cases in which the landslide locations and timing were randomized and the landslide sample size was reduced showed the sensitivity of the Imax rainfall threshold model. Jack-knife and cross-validation experiments demonstrated that the model was robust. The results reported here highlight the potential of using rainfall ID threshold curves and rainfall threshold values for predicting the occurrence of landslides on a country or regional scale with possible applications in landslide warning systems, even with daily data.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a new parameterization to represent surface and groundwater interaction dynamics for land surface models. With the new parameterization, effects of surface and groundwater interactions on soil moisture, evapotranspiration, runoff, and recharge can be dynamically taken into account. The new parameterization is implemented into the three-layer variable infiltration capacity (VIC-3L) model, which is a hydrologically based land surface scheme. The new version of VIC (called VIC-ground) is applied to two watersheds in Pennsylvania over multiple years. Results show that VIC-ground can properly simulate the movement of the daily groundwater table over multiple years at the study sites. Preliminary comparisons of VIC simulations with and without consideration of the dynamics of surface and groundwater interactions show an important impact of such interactions on the partitioning of water budget components. In particular, soil moisture of the lower layer from the VIC-ground simulations is generally wetter than that from VIC-3L. For the top thin soil layer and the upper layer of VIC-3L, soil moisture is generally drier in VIC-ground than that in VIC-3L. Such characteristics of VIC-ground result in lower surface runoff peaks and higher base flow, as well as generally less evapotranspiration compared to VIC-3L at the two study sites. Results at both sites show that it takes 3\textendash 4 years to have the effects of the initializations of groundwater tables disappear when the groundwater table is initialized to be deeper than the observed level, while it takes much less time (e.g., about 1.5 years) if the groundwater table is initialized to be shallower than the observed level. In addition, the preliminary sensitivity studies at both sites show that there is a more significant persistent signature of the impact of the precipitation when its amount is halved (i.e., 0.5 ppt) than that when its amount is doubled (i.e., 2 ppt).},

The new model is comprised of a two-layer characterization of the soil column, and uses an aerodynamic representation of the latent and sensible heat fluxes at the land surface. The infiltration algorithm for the upper layer is essentially the same as for the single layer VIC model, while the lower layer drainage formulation is of the form previously implemented in the Max-Planck-Institut GCM. The model partitions the area of interest (e.g., grid cell) into multiple land surface cover types; for each land cover type the fraction of roots in the upper and lower zone is specified. Evapotranspiration consists of three components: canopy evaporation, evaporation from bare soils, and transpiration, which is represented using a canopy and architectural resistance formulation. Once the latent heat flux has been computed, the surface energy balance is iterated to solve for the land surface temperature at each time step. The model was tested using long-term hydrologic and climatological data for Kings Creek, Kansas to estimate and validate the hydrological parameters, and surface flux data from three First International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project Field Experiment intensive field campaigns in the summer-fall of 1987 to validate the surface energy fluxes.},

  abstract = {The key to advancing the predictability of rainfall-triggered landslides is to use physically based slope-stability models that simulate the transient dynamical response of the subsurface moisture to spatiotemporal variability of rainfall in complex terrains. TRIGRS (transient rainfall infiltration and grid-based regional slope-stability analysis) is a USGS landslide prediction model, coded in Fortran, that accounts for the influences of hydrology, topography, and soil physics on slope stability. In this study, we quantitatively evaluate the spatiotemporal predictability of a Matlab version of TRIGRS (MaTRIGRS) in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Macon County, North Carolina where Hurricanes Ivan triggered widespread landslides in the 2004 hurricane season. High resolution digital elevation model (DEM) data (6-m LiDAR), USGS STATSGO soil database, and NOAA/NWS combined radar and gauge precipitation are used as inputs to the model. A local landslide inventory database from North Carolina Geological Survey is used to evaluate the MaTRIGRS' predictive skill for the landslide locations and timing, identifying predictions within a 120-m radius of observed landslides over the 30-h period of Hurricane Ivan's passage in September 2004. Results show that within a radius of 24 m from the landslide location about 67\% of the landslide, observations could be successfully predicted but with a high false alarm ratio (90\%). If the radius of observation is extended to 120 m, 98\% of the landslides are detected with an 18\% false alarm ratio. This study shows that MaTRIGRS demonstrates acceptable spatiotemporal predictive skill for landslide occurrences within a 120-m radius in space and a hurricane-event-duration (h) in time, offering the potential to serve as a landslide warning system in areas where accurate rainfall forecasts and detailed field data are available. The validation can be further improved with additional landslide information including the exact time of failure for each landslide and the landslide's extent and run out length.},

  abstract = {An early warning system has been developed to predict rainfall-induced shallow landslides over Java Island, Indonesia. The prototyped early warning system integrates three major components: (1) a susceptibility mapping and hotspot identification component based on a land surface geospatial database (topographical information, maps of soil properties, and local landslide inventory, etc.); (2) a satellite-based precipitation monitoring system (http://trmm.gsfc.nasa.gov) and a precipitation forecasting model (i.e., Weather Research Forecast); and (3) a physically based, rainfall-induced landslide prediction model SLIDE. The system utilizes the modified physical model to calculate a factor of safety that accounts for the contribution of rainfall infiltration and partial saturation to the shear strength of the soil in topographically complex terrains. In use, the land-surface ``where'' information will be integrated with the ``when'' rainfall triggers by the landslide prediction model to predict potential slope failures as a function of time and location. In this system, geomorphologic data are primarily based on 30-m Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data, digital elevation model (DEM), and 1-km soil maps. Precipitation forcing comes from both satellite-based, real-time National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), and Weather Research Forecasting (WRF) model forecasts. The system's prediction performance has been evaluated using a local landslide inventory, and results show that the system successfully predicted landslides in correspondence to the time of occurrence of the real landslide events. Integration of spatially distributed remote sensing precipitation products and in-situ datasets in this prototype system enables us to further develop a regional, early warning tool in the future for predicting rainfall-induced landslides in Indonesia.},

  abstract = {This study utilizes GIS modeling to determine if the location of 559 landslides in the 875 km2 catchment of the Middle Fork of the Payette River, Idaho can be predicted based on topographic attributes and a wetness index generated by the DYNWET model. Slope and elevation were significantly related to landslide occurrence at this landscape scale. Aspect was also retained as a variable for further analysis because, despite a non-significant chi-square relation to landslide occurrence, graphical analysis suggested a relation between aspect and mass wasting. Chi-square analysis indicated that plan and profile curvature, flow path length, upslope contributing area, and the DYNWET-based moisture index were not significantly related to landsliding. A Bayesian probability model based on combinations of elevation, slope, aspect, and wetness indicates that elevation exhibits the closest relation to landsliding, followed by slope; but that neither aspect nor wetness index values help in prediction. The Bayesian probability model using elevation and slope generates a map of relative landslide risk that can be used to direct activities away from mass wasting prone areas. The association between elevation and landslides is perplexing but is perhaps due to the location of logging road at specific elevations (roads could not be included in the input data for analysis because they have not been adequately mapped). The lack of explanation provided by the DYNWET wetness index was also surprising and may be due to the 30-m digital elevation model (DEM) and the soils data having resolutions too coarse to adequately portray local variations key to mass wasting. We believe the inadequacy of data to drive the models is typical of the majority of catchment scale setting. For now, the ability of researchers to effectively model landscape scale landsliding is more limited by the type, resolution, and quality of available data than by the quality of the landslide models.},

  abstract = {The Chenyulan River watershed in central Taiwan was chosen for evaluating the impact of the Chi-Chi earthquake on the occurrence of landslides, and for exploring the initial conditions triggering debris flows. Interpretations of aerial photographs and SPOT images as well as field investigations were used to identify landslide and debris flow occurrences. Precipitation data were then utilized to investigate critical conditions leading to the debris flow. Comparison of five SPOT images taken between June 1996 (before the July 1996 Typhoon Herb) and September 1999 (before the Chi-Chi earthquake) shows that the landslide area increased from 7.1\texttimes 106 to 7.5\texttimes 106 m2 during that time. However, by January 2000 (after the Chi-Chi earthquake), the landslide area almost tripled to 20.8\texttimes 106 m2. Measurement of images taken in March and August 2001 reveals that the landslide area had further expanded to 24.2\texttimes 106 and 27.5\texttimes 106 m2, respectively. Significant differences before and after the earthquake are also noticed in (1) the intensity and amount of precipitation required for triggering debris flow, (2) the size of contributing drainage basin in which debris flows occurred, and (3) the frequency of debris flows. After the Chi-Chi earthquake, maximum hourly rainfall intensity and critical accumulated precipitation necessary to initiate debris flow reduced to as low as 1/3 of the pre-earthquake figures. Prior to the Chi-Chi earthquake, most debris flows occurred in gullies with slopes greater than 10\textdegree, and in drainage basins larger than 0.1 km2. Conversely, after the earthquake, debris flows were observed even in gullies with effective drainage area smaller than 0.03 km2. Furthermore, before the earthquake, the debris flow recurrence time in the study area was greater than 5 years, whereas six debris flow events have been observed in the 2 years since the earthquake.},

After surface strata have been highly disturbed heavy rainfalls in 2000 and 2001 have triggered more landslides than the earthquake itself. Compared with the data obtained from images before the earthquake, it is obvious that the density of rainfall-induced landslides increased significantly after the earthquake, and the places where landslides occurred changed, as well. Although typhoon Herb in 1996 brought more precipitation than typhoon Toraji in 2001, only 9.77~km2 landslides were induced by Herb, while 48.8~km2 landslides\textendash almost five times larger than those caused by Herb\textendash were triggered by Toraji. Besides, landslides induced by Herb were mainly distributed in mid-slope areas, with slopes of 20\textendash 30\textdegree.

Findings from studies published in recent years have remarkably increased our understanding of fire\textendash climate interactions and improved our capacity to delineate probable future climate change and impacts. Fires are projected to increase in many regions of the globe under a changing climate due to the greenhouse effect. Burned areas in the western US could increase by more than 50\% by the middle of this century. Increased fire activity is not simply an outcome of the changing climate, but also a participant in the change. Smoke particles reduce overall solar radiation absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere during individual fire events and fire seasons, leading to regional climate effects including reduction in surface temperature, suppression of cloud and precipitation, and enhancement of climate anomalies such as droughts. Black carbon (BC) in smoke particles displays some different radiation and climate effects by warming the middle and lower atmosphere, leading to a more stable atmosphere. BC also plays a key role in the smoke-snow feedback mechanism. Fire emissions of CO2, on the other hand, are an important atmospheric CO2 source and contribute substantially to the global greenhouse effect. Future studies should generate a global picture of all aspects of radiative forcing by smoke particles. Better knowledge is needed in space and time variability of smoke particles, evolution of smoke optical properties, estimation of smoke plume height and vertical profiles and their impacts on locations of warming layers, stability structure, clouds and smoke transport, quantification of BC emission factors and optical properties from different forest fuels, and BC's individual and combined roles with organic carbon. Finally, understanding the short- and long-term greenhouse effect of fire CO2 emissions, increased capacity to project future fire trends (especially mega-fires), with consideration of climate\textendash fuel\textendash human interactions, and improved fire weather and climate prediction skills (including exploring the SST-fire relations) remain central knowledge needs.},

The study objective was to assess uncertainty in ET output from four land surface models (LSMs), Noah, Mosaic, VIC, and SAC in NLDAS-2, two remote sensing-based products, MODIS and AVHRR, and GRACE-inferred ET from a water budget with precipitation from PRISM, monitored runoff, and total water storage change (TWSC) from GRACE satellites. The three cornered hat method, which does not require a priori knowledge of the true ET value, was used to estimate ET uncertainties. In addition, TWSC or total water storage anomaly (TWSA) from GRACE was compared with water budget estimates of TWSC from a flux-based approach or TWSA from a storage-based approach. The analyses were conducted using data from three regions (humid-arid) in the South Central United States as case studies. Uncertainties in ET are lowest in LSM ET ({$\sim$}5 mm/mo), moderate in MODIS or AVHRR-based ET (10\textendash 15 mm/mo), and highest in GRACE-inferred ET (20\textendash 30 mm/month). There is a trade-off between spatial resolution and uncertainty, with lower uncertainty in the coarser-resolution LSM ET ({$\sim$}14 km) relative to higher uncertainty in the finer-resolution ({$\sim$}1\textendash 8 km) RS ET. Root-mean-square (RMS) of uncertainties in water budget estimates of TWSC is about half of RMS of uncertainties in GRACE-derived TWSC for each of the regions. Future ET estimation should consider a hybrid approach that integrates strengths of LSMs and satellite-based products to constrain uncertainties.},

  abstract = {The synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry (InSAR) technique has already shown its importance in landslide mapping and monitoring applications. However, the usefulness of traditional differential InSAR applications is limited by disturbing factors such as temporal decorrelation and atmospheric disturbances. The Persistent Scatterers Interferometry (PSI) technique is a recently developed InSAR approach. It generates stable radar benchmarks (namely persistent scatterers, PSI point targets) using a multi-interferogram analysis of SAR images. The PSI technique has the advantage of reducing temporal decorrelation and atmospheric artefacts. The PSI technique is suitable for the investigation of extremely slow-moving landslides due to its capability to detect ground displacements with millimetre precision. However, the interpretation of PSI outputs is sometimes difficult for the large number of possible persistent scatterers (PSs). A new approach of PSI Hotspot and Cluster Analysis (PSI-HCA) is introduced here in order to develop a procedure for mapping landslides efficiently and automatically. This analysis has been performed on PSs in hilly and mountainous areas within the Arno river basin (Italy). The aim is to use PSs processed from 4 years (2003\textendash 2006) of Radarsat images for identifying areas preferentially affected by extremely slow-moving landslides. The Getis\textendash Ord Gi * statistic is applied in the study for the PSI-HCA approach. The velocity of PSs is used as weighting factor and the Gi * index is calculated for each single point target. The results indicate that both high positive and low negative Gi * values imply the clustering of potential mass movements. High positive values suggest the moving direction towards the sensor along the satellite line-of-sight (LOS), whereas low negative values imply the movement away from the sensor. Furthermore, the kernel function is used to estimate PS density based on these derived Gi * values. The output is a hotspot map which highlights active mass movements. This spatial statistic approach of PSI-HCA is considered an effective way to extract useful information from PSs at a regional scale, thus providing an innovative approach for rapid mapping of extremely slow-moving landslides over large areas.},

According to the working scale (1:10000) and to the availability and accuracy of the input data, the infinite slope analysis was judged to be the most appropriate method, but particular attention was devoted to the error evaluation due to spatial variability of the geotechnic, geometric, and hydrologic parameters. A geologic, geomorphologic and hydrologic survey of the area was therefore performed, and the geotechnic parameters were collected at local administrations. All the data were stored in a GIS, used as a tool to build the spatial and attribute data base and to prepare the input data layers for the stability analysis. In order to assess the variability of geotechnic parameters, a statistical analysis was performed to assign the best-fitting probability distribution to cohesion, angle of internal friction and unit weight of the soil. As hydrogeologic data were not available for the area, only surface hydrology information could be used; a map of probability of spring occurrences was derived by a bayesian method, the Weight of Evidence Modelling, and was used as groundwater indicator. A Monte Carlo procedure and a first-order second-moment method were applied and compared as error estimators in assessing the slope susceptibility to failure. The differences between the two methods are discussed, and two maps showing, respectively, the critical horizontal acceleration and the probability of failure associated with each slope are presented, together with the curve plotting the reliability index against the probability of failure.},

The quantification of errors associated with satellite precipitation products (SPPs) is crucial for a correct use of these datasets in hydrological applications, climate studies, and water resources management. This study presents a review of previous work that focused on validating SPPs for liquid precipitation during the TRMM era through comparisons with surface observations, both in terms of mean errors and detection capabilities across different regions of the world. Several SPPs have been considered: TMPA 3B42 (research and real-time products), CPC morphing technique (CMORPH), Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP; both the near-real-time and the Motion Vector Kalman filter products), PERSIANN, and PERSIANN\textendash Cloud Classification System (PERSIANN-CCS). Topography, seasonality, and climatology were shown to play a role in the SPP's performance, especially in terms of detection probability and bias. Regions with complex terrain exhibited poor rain detection and magnitude-dependent mean errors; low probability of detection was reported in semiarid areas. Winter seasons, usually associated with lighter rain events, snow, and mixed-phase precipitation, showed larger biases.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

In contrast, reanalyses exhibit a very poor performance, with correlations below 0.4 and large biases in most of the cases. Secondly, a Mann-Kendall trend analysis is carried out. In most cases, GMet data reveal the existence of predominant decreasing (increasing) trends for the first (second) half of the period of study, 1961\textendash 1985 (1986\textendash 2010). Again, observational products are shown to reproduce well the observed trends\textemdash with worst results for purely satellite-derived data\textemdash whereas reanalyses lead in general to unrealistic stronger than observed trends, with contradictory results (opposite signs for different reanalyses) in some cases.

Here, we use a long-term rainfall data set from the Japanese radar network to discuss why the landslide pattern caused by a major typhoon poorly correlates with the event rainfall but agrees with the event rainfall normalized by the 10-year return period rainfall amount, that is, a rainfall anomaly. This may be explained if the variability in hillslope properties has coevolved with the recent climate and can be accounted for with such normalization. Further, rock types seem to respond to rainfall anomalies at various timescales, favoring specific landslide geometries, and suggesting various hydrological properties in these zones. The computation of rainfall anomalies for multiple timescales may pave the way toward operational landslide forecasts in case of large storms.},

  abstract = {Recognition and classification of landslides is a critical requirement in pre- and post-disaster hazard analysis. This has been primarily done through field mapping or manual image interpretation. However, image interpretation can also be done semi-automatically by creating a routine in object-based classification using the spectral, spatial and morphometric properties of landslides, and by incorporating expert knowledge. This is a difficult task since a fresh landslide has spectral properties that are nearly identical to those of other natural objects, such as river sand and rocky outcrops, and they also do not have unique shapes. This paper investigates the use of a combination of spectral, shape and contextual information to detect landslides. The algorithm is tested with a 5.8m multispectral data from Resourcesat-1 and a 10m digital terrain model generated from 2.5m Cartosat-1 imagery for an area in the rugged Himalayas in India. It uses objects derived from the segmentation of a multispectral image as classifying units for object-oriented analysis. Spectral information together with shape and morphometric characteristics was used initially to separate landslides from false positives. Objects recognised as landslides were subsequently classified based on material type and movement as debris slides, debris flows and rock slides, using adjacency and morphometric criteria. They were further classified for their failure mechanism using terrain curvature. The procedure was developed for a training catchment and then applied without further modification on an independent catchment. A total of five landslide types were detected by this method with 76.4\% recognition and 69.1\% classification accuracies. This method detects landslides relatively quickly, and hence has the potential to aid risk analysis, disaster management and decision making processes in the aftermath of an earthquake or an extreme rainfall event.},

  abstract = {Landslide inventories prepared manually from remote sensing data or through field surveys have shown to be useful for preparation of landslide susceptibility and hazard maps. Recent literatures show several studies have been carried out to prepare landslide inventories from satellite data by automatic methods. However, almost no attempt has been made to validate the effect of such inventories on landslide hazard and risk assessment. In this paper we have shown how landslide inventories prepared by semi-automatic methods from post-event satellite images can be used in the assessment of landslide susceptibility, hazard and risk in the High Himalayan terrain in India. A susceptibility map was made using the weights-of-evidence method, wherein weights were derived using the semi-automatically prepared historical landslide inventories combined with a series of pre-disposing factor maps. Seven evidence layers were used for the calculation of weights, selected in such a way that the majority could be derived from satellite data. Validation was done using the test data created through a temporal subsetting of the inventories. Temporal probability was calculated through Gumbel frequency distribution analysis using daily rainfall data of a 13year period for which landslide inventories were prepared from satellite data. Spatial probability was determined by calculating landslide density for the inventories per susceptibility class that represent a given return period. Elements at risk, such as buildings and roads, were interpreted from a high resolution Cartosat-1 (2.5m) image. Absolute vulnerability of the buildings and roads were multiplied with landslide spatial probability to derive the total loss for different return-period scenarios and shown in a risk curve. This study has shown that the inventories prepared semi-automatically can be used for landslide hazard and risk assessment in a data-poor environment.},

  abstract = {Object-oriented analysis (OOA) has been demonstrated to produce more accurate results than pixel-based image processing. Studies carried out by previous researchers have shown how landslide inventories can be prepared from multispectral satellite images using OOA. However, panchromatic images are frequently the only data available after a landslide event. Furthermore, preparation of historical inventories relies on the analysis of satellite images and aerial photographs acquired over past few decades that are also mostly only available in black and white. In such cases the methodology developed using multispectral data cannot be used directly due to limited spectral information, in particular in near-infrared bands. In this paper we present a new methodology that addresses some of these issues. Using high resolution panchromatic images from Cartosat-1 (2.5m) and IRS-1D (5.8m), and a 10m gridded DTM extracted from Cartosat-1, we developed a new approach which uses change detection techniques and a global contextual criteria in an object-based environment to detect and classify landslides into five different types. Continuous time series images from 1998 to 2006 were used to prepare annual landslide inventories in a highly rugged Himalayan terrain. The maximum and minimum detection percentages achieved for all landslides are 96.7\% and 71.5\%, respectively, with corresponding quality percentages of 88.1\% and 55.3\%, respectively. However, the lack of spectral information proved to be a hurdle resulting in a high branching factor that indicates that further work is required to eliminate false positives. Nevertheless, the method was able to create much needed historical landslide inventories, which are critical for landslide hazard and risk assessment studies.},

Specifically, the objectives were to present an approximation of the sampling distribution of the index; provide a method for conducting hypothesis tests and computing confidence intervals for sample values; and identify the effects of factors that influence sample values of Ef including the sample size, outliers, bias in magnitude, time-offset bias of hydrograph models, and the sampling interval of hydrologic data. Actual hydrologic data and hypothetical analyses were used to show these effects. The analyses show that outliers can significantly influence sample values of Ef. Time-offset bias and bias in magnitude can have an adverse effect on Ef. The time step at which the data are recorded appears to be an insignificant factor unless the sample size is small. The Nash\textendash Sutcliffe index can be a reliable goodnessof-fit statistic if it is properly interpreted.},

The impact of these local controls on catchment-scale geomorphic patterns, however, is less certain. A case study of one arctic river in northern Alaska, USA, reveals hydraulic geometry anomalies that can be reasonably explained by the influence of ice and permafrost on local channel form.

In Nepal, there were several attempts to map landslides in detail after the Gorkha earthquake. Particularly after the main event on 25 April 2015, researchers around the world mapped the landslides induced by this earthquake. In this research, we compared four of these published inventories qualitatively and quantitatively using different techniques. Two principal methodologies, namely the cartographical degree of matching and frequency area distribution (FAD), were optimized and applied to evaluate inventory maps. We also showed the impact of using satellite imagery with different spatial resolutions on the landslide inventory generation by analyzing matches and mismatches between the inventories. The results of our work give an overview of the impact of methodology selection and outline the limitations and advantages of different remote sensing and mapping techniques for landslide inventorying.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a procedure for landslide susceptibility assessment based on artificial neural networks, and focuses on the estimation of the prediction capability, robustness, and sensitivity of susceptibility models. The study is carried out in the Guantanamo Province of Cuba, where 186 landslides were mapped using photo-interpretation. Twelve conditioning factors were mapped including geomorphology, geology, soils, landuse, slope angle, slope direction, internal relief, drainage density, distance from roads and faults, rainfall intensity, and ground peak acceleration. A methodology was used that subdivided the database in 3 subsets. A training set was used for updating the weights. A validation set was used to stop the training procedure when the network started losing generalization capability, and a test set was used to calculate the performance of the network. A 10-fold cross-validation was performed in order to show that the results are repeatable. The prediction capability, the robustness analysis, and the sensitivity analysis were tested on 10 mutually exclusive datasets. The results show that by means of artificial neural networks it is possible to obtain models with high prediction capability and high robustness, and that an exploration of the effect of the individual variables is possible, even if they are considered as a black-box model.},

  abstract = {An accurate inventory map is a prerequisite for the analysis of landslide susceptibility, hazard, and risk. Field survey, optical remote sensing, and synthetic aperture radar techniques are traditional techniques for landslide detection in tropical regions. However, such techniques are time consuming and costly. In addition, the dense vegetation of tropical forests complicates the generation of an accurate landslide inventory map for these regions. Given its ability to penetrate vegetation cover, high-resolution airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) has been used to generate accurate landslide maps. This study proposes the use of recurrent neural networks (RNN) and multi-layer perceptron neural networks (MLP-NN) in landscape detection. These efficient neural architectures require little or no prior knowledge compared with traditional classification methods. The proposed methods were tested in the Cameron Highlands, Malaysia. Segmentation parameters and feature selection were respectively optimized using a supervised approach and correlation-based feature selection. The hyper-parameters of network architecture were defined based on a systematic grid search. The accuracies of the RNN and MLP-NN models in the analysis area were 83.33\% and 78.38\%, respectively. The accuracies of the RNN and MLP-NN models in the test area were 81.11\%, and 74.56\%, respectively. These results indicated that the proposed models with optimized hyper-parameters produced the most accurate classification results. LiDAR-derived data, orthophotos, and textural features significantly affected the classification results. Therefore, the results indicated that the proposed methods have the potential to produce accurate and appropriate landslide inventory in tropical regions such as Malaysia.},

Despite the recent revolution in digital elevation data and remote sensing technologies, landslide mapping remains resource intensive. Consequently, a modern, comprehensive map of landslide occurrence across the United States (USA) has not been compiled. As a first step toward this goal, we present a national-scale compilation of existing, publicly available landslide inventories. This geodatabase can be downloaded in its entirety or viewed through an online, searchable map, with parsimonious attributes and direct links to the contributing sources with additional details. The mapped spatial pattern and concentration of landslides are consistent with prior characterization of susceptibility within the conterminous USA, with some notable exceptions on the West Coast. Although the database is evolving and known to be incomplete in many regions, it confirms that landslides do occur across the country, thus highlighting the importance of our national-scale assessment. The map illustrates regions where high-quality mapping has occurred and, in contrast, where additional resources could improve confidence in landslide characterization. For example, borders between states and other jurisdictions are quite apparent, indicating the variation in approaches to data collection by different agencies and disparity between the resources dedicated to landslide characterization. Further investigations are needed to better assess susceptibility and to determine whether regions with high relief and steep topography, but without mapped landslides, require further landslide inventory mapping. Overall, this map provides a new resource for accessing information about known landslides across the USA.},

  abstract = {Increased erosion is a well-known response after wildfire. To predict and to model erosion on a landscape scale requires knowledge of the critical shear stress for the initiation of motion of soil particles. As this soil property is temperature-dependent, a quantitative relation between critical shear stress and the temperatures to which the soils have been subjected during a wildfire is required. In this study the critical shear stress was measured in a recirculating flume using samples of forest soil exposed to different temperatures (40\textdegree\textendash 550\textdegree C) for 1 hour. Results were obtained for four replicates of soils derived from three different types of parent material (granitic bedrock, sandstone, and volcanic tuffs). In general, the relation between critical shear stress and temperature can be separated into three different temperature ranges ({$<$}175\textdegree C; 175\textdegree C\textendash 275\textdegree C; {$>$}275\textdegree C), which are similar to those for water repellency and temperature. The critical shear stress was most variable (1.0\textendash 2.0 N m-2) for temperatures {$<$}175\textdegree C, was a maximum ({$>$}2.0 N m-2) between 175\textdegree{} and 275\textdegree C, and was essentially constant (0.5\textendash 0.8 N m-2) for temperatures {$>$}275\textdegree C. The changes in critical shear stress with temperature were found to be essentially independent of soil type and suggest that erosion processes in burned watersheds can be modeled more simply than erosion processes in unburned watersheds. Wildfire reduces the spatial variability of soil erodibility associated with unburned watersheds by eliminating the complex effects of vegetation in protecting soils and by reducing the range of cohesion associated with different types of unburned soils. Our results indicate that modeling the erosional response after a wildfire depends primarily on determining the spatial distribution of the maximum soil temperatures that were reached during the wildfire.},

  abstract = {A wildfire in May 1996 burned 4690 hectares in two watersheds forested by ponderosa pine and Douglas fir in a steep, mountainous landscape with a summer, convective thunderstorm precipitation regime. The wildfire lowered the erosion threshold in the watersheds, and consequently amplified the subsequent erosional response to shorter time interval episodic rainfall and created both erosional and depositional features in a complex pattern throughout the watersheds. The initial response during the first four years was an increase in runoff and erosion rates followed by decreases toward pre-fire rates. The maximum unit-area peak discharge was 24 m3 s-1 km-2 for a rainstorm in 1996 with a rain intensity of 90 mm h-1. Recovery to pre-fire conditions seems to have occurred by 2000 because for a maximum 30-min rainfall intensity of 50 mm h-1, the unit-area peak discharge in 1997 was 6.6 m3 s-1 km-2, while in 2000 a similar intensity produced only 0.11 m3 s-1 km-2. Rill erosion accounted for 6 per cent, interrill erosion for 14 per cent, and drainage erosion for 80 per cent of the initial erosion in 1996. This represents about a 200-fold increase in erosion rates on hillslopes which had a recovery or relaxation time of about three years. About 67 per cent of the initially eroded sediment is still stored in the watersheds after four years with an estimated residence time greater than 300 years. This residence time is much greater than the fire recurrence interval so erosional and depositional features may become legacies from the wildfire and may affect landscape evolution by acting as a new set of initial conditions for subsequent wildfire and flood sequences.

  abstract = {Summary Heat from wildfires can produce a two-layer system composed of extremely dry soil covered by a layer of ash, which when subjected to rainfall, may produce extreme floods. To understand the soil physics controlling runoff for these initial conditions, we used a small, portable disk infiltrometer to measure two hydraulic properties: (1) near-saturated hydraulic conductivity, Kf and (2) sorptivity, S(\texttheta i), as a function of initial soil moisture content, \texttheta i, ranging from extremely dry conditions (\texttheta i{$<$}0.02cm3cm-3) to near saturation. In the field and in the laboratory replicate measurements were made of ash, reference soils, soils unaffected by fire, and fire-affected soils. Each has a different degrees of water repellency that influences Kf and S(\texttheta i). Values of Kf ranged from 4.5\texttimes 10-3 to 53\texttimes 10-3cms-1 for ash; from 0.93\texttimes 10-3 to 130\texttimes 10-3cms-1 for reference soils; and from 0.86\texttimes 10-3 to 3.0\texttimes 10-3cms-1, for soil unaffected by fire, which had the lowest values of Kf. Measurements indicated that S(\texttheta i) could be represented by an empirical non-linear function of \texttheta i with a sorptivity maximum of 0.18\textendash 0.20cms-0.5, between 0.03 and 0.08cm3cm-3. This functional form differs from the monotonically decreasing non-linear functions often used to represent S(\texttheta i) for rainfall\textendash runoff modeling. The sorptivity maximum may represent the combined effects of gravity, capillarity, and adsorption in a transitional domain corresponding to extremely dry soil, and moreover, it may explain the observed non-linear behavior, and the critical soil-moisture threshold of water repellent soils. Laboratory measurements of Kf and S(\texttheta i) are the first for ash and fire-affected soil, but additional measurements are needed of these hydraulic properties for in situ fire-affected soils. They provide insight into water repellency behavior and infiltration under extremely dry conditions. Most importantly, they indicate how existing rainfall\textendash runoff models can be modified to accommodate a possible two-layer system in extremely dry conditions. These modified models can be used to predict floods from burned watersheds under these initial conditions.},

  abstract = {Extreme floods often follow wildfire in mountainous watersheds. However, a quantitative relation between the runoff response and burn severity at the watershed scale has not been established. Runoff response was measured as the runoff coefficient C, which is equal to the peak discharge per unit drainage area divided by the average maximum 30 min rainfall intensity during each rain storm. The magnitude of the burn severity was expressed as the change in the normalized burn ratio. A new burn severity variable, hydraulic functional connectivity {$\Phi$} was developed and incorporates both the magnitude of the burn severity and the spatial sequence of the burn severity along hillslope flow paths. The runoff response and the burn severity were measured in seven subwatersheds (0{$\cdot$}24 to 0{$\cdot$}85 km2) in the upper part of Rendija Canyon burned by the 2000 Cerro Grande Fire near Los Alamos, New Mexico, USA. A rainfall\textendash discharge relation was determined for four of the subwatersheds with nearly the same burn severity. The peak discharge per unit drainage area \$Q\_ m u\^ m peak\$ was a linear function of the maximum 30 min rainfall intensity I30. This function predicted a rainfall intensity threshold of 8{$\cdot$}5 mm h-1 below which no runoff was generated. The runoff coefficient \$C = Q\_ m u\^ m peak/I\_30\$ was a linear function of the mean hydraulic functional connectivity of the subwatersheds. Moreover, the variability of the mean hydraulic functional connectivity was related to the variability of the mean runoff coefficient, and this relation provides physical insight into why the runoff response from the same subwatershed can vary for different rainstorms with the same rainfall intensity.

Annual post-fire sediment yields were computed and grouped into four measurement methods (hillslope point and plot measurements, channel measurements of suspended-sediment and sediment erosion or deposition volumes). Post-fire sediment yields for each method were then grouped into eight different rainfall regimes. Mean sediment yield from channels (240 t ha\textendash 1) was significantly greater than from hillslopes (82 t ha\textendash 1). This indicated that on the time scale of wildfire (10\textendash 100 years) channels were the primary sources of available sediment. A lack of correlation of sediment yield with topographic slope and soil erodibility further suggested that sediment availability may be more important than slope or soil erodibility in predicting post-fire sediment yields. The maximum post-fire sediment yields were comparable to long-term sediment yields from major rivers of the world. Based on 80 years of data from the literature, wildfires have been an important geomorphic agent of landscape change when linked with sufficient rainfall. These effects are limited in spatial scale to the immediate burned area and to downstream channel corridors.},

The relationship between landslides and various instability factors contributing to their occurrence was evaluated using a Geographic Information System (GIS) based investigation. A landslide inventory map was prepared using landslide locations identified from aerial photographs, field checks, and existing literature. Instability factors such as slope angle, soil type, soil erodibility, soil liquidity index, landcover pattern, precipitation, and proximity to stream, responsible for the occurrence of landslides, were imported as raster data layers in ArcGIS, and ranked using a numerical scale corresponding to the physical conditions of the region. In order to investigate the role of each instability factor in controlling the spatial distribution of landslides, both bivariate and multivariate models were used to analyze the digital dataset. The logistic regression approach was used in the multivariate model analysis. Both models helped produce landslide susceptibility maps and the suitability of each model was evaluated by the area under the curve method, and by comparing the maps with the known landslide locations. The multivariate logistic regression model was found to be the better model in predicting landslide susceptibility of this area. The logistic regression model produced a landslide susceptibility map at a scale of 1:24,000 that classified susceptibility into four categories: low, moderate, high, and very high. The results also indicated that slope angle, proximity to stream, soil erodibility, and soil type were statistically significant in controlling the slope movement.},

According to the results of the AUC evaluation, the produced map has exhibited a good enough performance.},

Variations on accuracy and precision values of the models constructed considering different algorithms were also investigated. For this purpose, two most popular techniques, logistic regression analysis and back-propagation artificial neural networks were taken into account. The town Ispir and its close vicinity (Northeastern part of Turkey), suffered from landsliding for many years was selected as the application site of this study. As a result, it is revealed that the back-propagation artificial neural network algorithms overreact to the samplings in which the presence (1) data were taken from the landslide masses. When the generalization capacities of the models are taken into consideration, these reactions cause imprecise results, even though the area under curve (AUC) values are very high (0.915},

For this reason, a large-scale study titled Turkish Landslide Inventory Project, has been carried out since 1998. During this project, some special, susceptibility, hazard and risk assessments have been performed. In this study, a landslide susceptibility map of a part of tectonic Kelkit Valley in the north of central Turkey was produced, employing binary logistic regression analyses. To achieve the most appropriate results some sensitivity analyses were also carried out. For this purpose, four different data sets were constructed considering conditioning factors used and sampling strategies applied for the training data sets in this study. As a consequence of the analyses, the most proper outcomes were obtained by using the data set in which continuous topographical parameters and lithological dummy variables were implemented together and 50\% of training data set was taken from seed cells at random. Correct classification percentage and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values for the validation data for that case were estimated as 84.16\% and 0.36, respectively. This prediction capability shows that the landslide susceptibility map produced in this research paper can be used for the planning of protective and mitigation measures in the region.},

Topographic errors such as ground clutter and beam blockage primarily can be eliminated by attentive in site selection. Atmospheric errors such as vertical air motion and precipitation drift can filter or eliminated by calibration methods. Systematic errors include radar signal attenuation and anomalous propagation is the result of structural changes in the radar waves in space.

  abstract = {Numerous reports of ``flash floods'', ``mud torrents'' and ``landslides'' in burnt landscapes of south-east Australia were only recently linked to debris flows and recognised as a significant process that warrant more detailed investigation. This paper provides a systematic documentation of high-magnitude erosion events after wildfire in south-east Australia, focusing on small ({$<$}5km2), upland catchments in eastern Victoria that were burnt by wildfire between 2003 and 2009. The aims of the study were to i) collect and show evidence of debris flow occurrence after wildfire; ii) quantify erosion rates from debris flows and; iii) identify rainfall thresholds and key hydrological properties. The result showed that 13 out of the 16 recorded high-magnitude erosion events were runoff generated debris flows. These occurred in dry eucalypt forests burnt at high or very high severity in steep headwater catchments throughout the eastern uplands of Victoria. The debris flows were triggered by intense, short duration rainfall events (I30 35\textendash 59mmh-1) with annual exceedance probability in the order of 20\%. This is the first paper to document the occurrence of post-fire runoff generated debris flows in Australia, so the discussion draws on literature from the western USA, where a large body of research has been dedicated to evaluating the risk posed by post-fire debris flows and their role in landscape processes. Typical features common to both systems include low infiltration capacity of burnt catchments; widespread sheet erosion and levee lined rills on steep upper hillslopes; and severe channel erosion initiated in response to convergent flow in previously un-scoured drainage lines. The depth of sheet erosion on surveyed slopes in the upper catchments (4.6{$\pm$}0.96 mm to 18.4{$\pm$}2.7mm) indicates that hillslope material provides an important source of sediment. The average channel entrainment rate of three debris flows ranged from 0.6 to 1.4m3m-1. Runoff generated debris flows were not recorded in wet or damp forest types suggesting that this process is unlikely to operate in these forest environments. One isolated case of mass failure generated debris flow was recorded in wet forest. The outcome of the study indicates that runoff generated debris flows in dry eucalypt forest are an important process to be considered during post-fire risk assessment of hydrological hazards.},

In the Lomerias Muertas area slope failure invariably starts by sliding, although many of the landslide masses soon develop into earthflows. Hinge slides are characteristic features of the steepest slopes, and slumps more commonly form on bedding dip slopes and other less steep slopes.

In this study, IMERG version 3 Early, Late, and Final (IMERG-E,IMERG-L, and IMERG-F) half-hourly rainfall estimates are compared with gauge-based gridded rainfall data from the WegenerNet Feldbach region (WEGN) high-density climate station network in southeastern Austria. The comparison is conducted over two IMERG 0.1\textdegree{} \texttimes{} 0.1\textdegree{} grid cells, entirely covered by 40 and 39 WEGN stations each, using data from the extended summer season (April\textendash October) for the first two years of the GPM mission. The entire data are divided into two rainfall intensity ranges (low and high) and two seasons (warm and hot), and we evaluate the performance of IMERG, using both statistical and graphical methods. Results show that IMERG-F rainfall estimates are in the best overall agreement with the WEGN data, followed by IMERG-L and IMERG-E estimates, particularly for the hot season. We also illustrate, through rainfall event cases, how insufficient PMW sources and errors in motion vectors can lead to wide discrepancies in the IMERG estimates. Finally, by applying the method of Villarini and Krajewski (2007), we find that IMERG-F half-hourly rainfall estimates can be regarded as a 25 min gauge accumulation, with an offset of +40 min relative to its nominal time.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

To address this problem, a statistical method called multiple logistic regression has been used to create a landslide-hazard map for Atchison, Kansas, and surrounding areas. Data included digitized geology, slopes, and landslides, manipulated using ArcView GIS. Logistic regression relates predictor variables to the occurrence or nonoccurrence of landslides within geographic cells and uses the relationship to produce a map showing the probability of future landslides, given local slopes and geologic units. Results indicated that slope is the most important variable for estimating landslide hazard in the study area. Geologic units consisting mostly of shale, siltstone, and sandstone were most susceptible to landslides. Soil type and aspect ratio were considered but excluded from the final analysis because these variables did not significantly add to the predictive power of the logistic regression. Soil types were highly correlated with the geologic units, and no significant relationships existed between landslides and slope aspect.},

  abstract = {Simulations of water transport in soil are ubiquitous, and the Richards' equation introduced in 1931 is the main tool for that purpose. For experiments on water transport in soil horizontal columns, Richards' equation predicts that volumetric water contents should depend solely on the ratio (distance)/(time)q where q=0.5. Substantial experimental evidence shows that value of q is significantly less than 0.5 in some cases. Donald Nielsen and colleagues in 1962 related values of q{$<$}0.5 to `jerky movements' of the wetting front, i.e. occurrences of rare large movements. The physical model of such transport is the transport of particles being randomly trapped and having a power law distribution of waiting periods. The corresponding mathematical model is a generalized Richards' equation in which the derivative of water content on time is a fractional one with the order equal or less than one. We solved this equation numerically and fitted the solution to data on horizontal water transport. The classical Richards' equation predicted a decrease of the soil water diffusivity for the same water content as infiltration progressed whereas the generalized Richards' equation described all observations well with a single diffusivity function. Validity of the generalized Richards' equation indicates presence of memory effects in soil water transport phenomena and may help to explain scale-dependence and variability in soil hydraulic conductivity encountered by researchers who applied classical Richards' equation.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Alluvial fans are continuously being developed for residential, industrial, commercial, and agricultural uses in southern California. Development and alteration of alluvial fans need to consider the possibility of mud and debris flows from upstream mountain watersheds affected by fires. Accurate prediction of sediment yield (or hyper-concentrated sediment yield) is essential for the design, operation, and maintenance of debris basins to safeguard properly the general populace. This paper presents a model for the prediction of sediment yields that result from a combination of fire and subsequent storm events. The watersheds used in this analysis are located in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains in southern California. A multiple regression analysis is first utilized to establish a fundamental statistical relationship for sediment yield as a function of relief ratio, drainage area, maximum 1-h rainfall intensity and fire factor using 45 years of data (1938-1983). In addition, a method for multi-sequence sediment yield prediction under fire conditions was developed and calibrated using 17 years of sediment yield, fire, and precipitation data for the period 1984-2000. After calibration, this model was verified by applying it to provide a prediction of the sediment yields for the 2001-2002 fire events in southern California. The findings indicate a strong correlation between the estimated and measured sediment yields. The proposed method for sequence sediment yield prediction following fire events can be a useful tool to schedule cleanout operations for debris basins and to develop an emergency response strategy for the southern California region where plentiful sediment supplies exist and frequent fires occur.},

The weighting-rating system based on the relative importance of various causative factors as derived from remotely sensed data and other thematic maps were used for the LHZ.

Each class within a thematic layer was assigned an ordinal rating from 0 to 9. Summation of these attribute maps were then multiplied by the corresponding weights to yield the Landslide Hazard Index (LHI) for each cell. Using trial and error method the weight-rating values have been re-adjusted. The LHI threshold values used were: 142, 165, 189 and 216.

  abstract = {One of the most significant effects of the 17 January, 1994 Northridge, California earthquake (M=6.7) was the triggering of thousands of landslides over a broad area. Some of these landslides damaged and destroyed homes and other structures, blocked roads, disrupted pipelines, and caused other serious damage. Analysis of the distribution and characteristics of these landslides is important in understanding what areas may be susceptible to landsliding in future earthquakes. We analyzed the frequency, distribution, and geometries of triggered landslides in the Santa Susana 7.5{${'}$} quadrangle, an area of intense seismic landslide activity near the earthquake epicenter. Landslides occurred primarily in young (Late Miocene through Pleistocene) uncemented or very weakly cemented sediment that has been repeatedly folded, faulted, and uplifted in the past 1.5 million years. The most common types of landslide triggered by the earthquake were highly disrupted, shallow falls and slides of rock and debris. Far less numerous were deeper, more coherent slumps and block slides, primarily occurring in more cohesive or competent materials. The landslides in the Santa Susana quadrangle were divided into two samples: single landslides (1502) and landslide complexes (60), which involved multiple coalescing failures of surficial material. We described landslide morphologies by computing simple morphometric parameters (area, length, width, aspect ratio, slope angle). To quantify and rank the relative susceptibility of each geologic unit to seismic landsliding, we calculated two indices: (1) the susceptibility index, which is the ratio (given as a percentage) of the area covered by landslide sources within a geologic unit to the total outcrop area of that unit; and (2) the frequency index [given in landslides per square kilometer (ls/km2)], which is the total number of landslides within each geologic unit divided by the outcrop area of that unit. Susceptibility categories include very high ({$>$}2.5\% landslide area or {$>$}30ls/km2), high (1.0\textendash 2.5\% landslide area or 10\textendash 30ls/km2), moderate (0.5\textendash 1.0\% landslide area or 3\textendash 10ls/km2), and low ({$<$}0.5\% landslide area and {$<$}3ls/km2).},

  abstract = {Power spectral analyses of soil moisture variability are carried out from scales of 100 m to 10 km on the microwave remotely-sensed data from the Washita experimental watershed during 1992. The power spectrum S(k) has an approximate power-law dependence on wave number k with the exponent -1.8. This behavior is consistent with the behavior of a stochastic differential equation for soil moisture at a point, and it has important consequences for the frequency-size distribution of landslides. We present the cumulative frequency-size distributions of landslides induced by precipitation in Japan and Bolivia as well as landslides triggered by the 1994 Northridge, California earthquake. Large landslides in these regions, despite being triggered by different mechanisms, have a cumulative frequency-size distribution with a power-law dependence on area with an exponent ranging from -1.5 to -2. We use a soil moisture field with the above statistics in conjunction with a slope stability analysis to model the frequency-size distribution of landslides. In our model, landslides occur when a threshold shear stress dependent on cohesion, pore pressure, internal friction and slope angle is exceeded. This implies a threshold dependence on soil moisture and slope angle since cohesion, pore pressure and internal friction are primarily dependent on soil moisture. The cumulative frequency-size distribution of domains of shear stress greater than a threshold value with soil moisture modeled as above and topography modeled as a Brownian walk is a power-law function of area with an exponent of -1.8 for large landslide areas. This distribution is similar to that observed for landslides. The effect of strong ground motion from earthquakes lowers the shear stress necessary for failure, but does not change the frequency-size distribution of failed areas. This is consistent with observations. This work suggests that remote sensing of soil moisture can be of great importance in monitoring landslide hazards and proposes a specific quantitative model for landslide hazard assessment.},

What is not appreciated is just how asymmetric this distribution is in time, and the even more asymmetric nature of trends due to climate change. We diagnose the temporal asymmetry in models and observations. Half of annual precipitation falls in the wettest 12 days each year in the median across observing stations worldwide. Climate models project changes in precipitation that are more uneven than present-day precipitation. In a scenario with high greenhouse-gas emissions, one fifth of the projected increase in rain falls in the wettest 2 days of the year and 70\% in the wettest 2 weeks. Adjusting modeled unevenness to match present-day unevenness at stations, half of precipitation increase occurs in the wettest 6 days each year.},

  abstract = {This paper considers the effects of antecedent precipitation on landslide incidence in the United Kingdom. During 2012\textendash 2013 an extraordinary amount of precipitation resulted in an increase in the number of landslides reported in the UK, highlighting the importance of hydrogeological triggering. Slope failures (landslides on engineered slopes) in particular caused widespread disruption to transport services and damage to property. SW England and S Wales were most affected. Easy-to-use and accessible indicators of potential landslide activity are required for planning, preparedness and response and therefore analyses have been carried out to determine whether antecedent effective precipitation can be used as a proxy for landslide incidence. It is shown that for all landslides long-term antecedent precipitation provides an important preparatory factor and that relatively small landslides, such as slope failures, occur within a short period of time following subsequent heavy precipitation. Deep-seated, rotational landslides have a longer response time, as their pathway to instability follows a much more complex hydrogeological response. Statistical analyses of the British Geological Survey landslide database and of weather records have enabled determination of the probability of at least one landslide occurring based on antecedent precipitation signals for SW England and S Wales. This ongoing research is of part of a suite of analyses to provide tools to identify the likelihood of regional landslide occurrence in the United Kingdom.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in theory and experimentation motivate a thorough reassessment of the physics of debris flows. Analyses of flows of dry, granular solids and solid-fluid mixtures provide a foundation for a comprehensive debris flow theory, and experiments provide data that reveal the strengths and limitations of theoretical models. Both debris flow materials and dry granular materials can sustain shear stresses while remaining static; both can deform in a slow, tranquil mode characterized by enduring, frictional grain contacts; and both can flow in a more rapid, agitated mode characterized by brief, inelastic grain collisions. In debris flows, however, pore fluid that is highly viscous and nearly incompressible, composed of water with suspended silt and clay, can strongly mediate intergranular friction and collisions. Grain friction, grain collisions, and viscous fluid flow may transfer significant momentum simultaneously. Both the vibrational kinetic energy of solid grains (measured by a quantity termed the granular temperature) and the pressure of the intervening pore fluid facilitate motion of grains past one another, thereby enhancing debris flow mobility. Granular temperature arises from conversion of flow translational energy to grain vibrational energy, a process that depends on shear rates, grain properties, boundary conditions, and the ambient fluid viscosity and pressure. Pore fluid pressures that exceed static equilibrium pressures result from local or global debris contraction. Like larger, natural debris flows, experimental debris flows of {$\sim$}10 m{$^3$} of poorly sorted, water-saturated sediment invariably move as an unsteady surge or series of surges. Measurements at the base of experimental flows show that coarse-grained surge fronts have little or no pore fluid pressure. In contrast, finer-grained, thoroughly saturated debris behind surge fronts is nearly liquefied by high pore pressure, which persists owing to the great compressibility and moderate permeability of the debris. Realistic models of debris flows therefore require equations that simulate inertial motion of surges in which high-resistance fronts dominated by solid forces impede the motion of low-resistance tails more strongly influenced by fluid forces. Furthermore, because debris flows characteristically originate as nearly rigid sediment masses, transform at least partly to liquefied flows, and then transform again to nearly rigid deposits, acceptable models must simulate an evolution of material behavior without invoking preternatural changes in material properties. A simple model that satisfies most of these criteria uses depth-averaged equations of motion patterned after those of the Savage-Hutter theory for gravity-driven flow of dry granular masses but generalized to include the effects of viscous pore fluid with varying pressure. These equations can describe a spectrum of debris flow behaviors intermediate between those of wet rock avalanches and sediment-laden water floods. With appropriate pore pressure distributions the equations yield numerical solutions that successfully predict unsteady, nonuniform motion of experimental debris flows.},

Systematic bias caused by wind is inherent in rainfall measurement and introduces an inconvenient unknown into hydrological science that is generally ignored. This paper examines the role of rain gauge shape and mounting height on catch efficiency (CE), where CE is defined as the ratio between nonreference and reference rainfall measurements. Using a pit gauge as a reference, we have demonstrated that rainfall measurements from an exposed upland site, recorded by an adjacent conventional cylinder rain gauge mounted at 0.5 m, were underestimated by more than 23\% on average. At an exposed lowland site, with lower wind speeds on average, the equivalent mean undercatch was 9.4\% for an equivalent gauge pairing. An improved-aerodynamic gauge shape enhanced CE when compared to a conventional cylinder gauge shape. For an improved-aerodynamic gauge mounted at 0.5 m above the ground, the mean undercatch was 11.2\% at the upland site and 3.4\% at the lowland site. The mounting height of a rain gauge above the ground also affected CE due to the vertical wind gradient near to the ground. Identical rain gauges mounted at 0.5 and 1.5 m were compared at an upland site, resulting in a mean undercatch of 11.2\% and 17.5\%, respectively. By selecting three large rainfall events and splitting them into shorter-duration intervals, a relationship explaining 81\% of the variance was established between CE and wind speed.},

At first, landslide locations were identified by aerial photographs and field surveys, and a total of 78 landslides were mapped from various sources. Then, the landslide inventory was randomly split into a training dataset 70 \% (55 landslides) for training the models and the remaining 30 \% (23 landslides) was used for validation purpose. Twelve data layers, as the landslide conditioning factors, are exploited to detect the most susceptible areas. These factors are slope degree, aspect, plan curvature, altitude, lithology, land use, distance from rivers, distance from roads, distance from faults, stream power index, slope length, and topographic wetness index. Subsequently, landslide susceptibility maps were produced using fuzzy logic and AHP models. For verification, receiver operating characteristics curve and area under the curve approaches were used. The verification results showed that the fuzzy logic model (89.7 \%) performed better than AHP (81.1 \%) model for the study area. The produced susceptibility maps can be used for general land use planning and hazard mitigation purpose.},

Landslide locations were determined in the study area by interpretation of aerial photographs and from field investigations. Topographical and geological data as well as satellite images were collected, processed, and constructed into a spatial database using GIS and image processing. Ten factors were selected for landslide hazard including: 1) factors related to topography as slope, aspect, and curvature; 2) factors related to geology as lithology and distance from lineament; 3) factors related to drainage as distance from drainage; and 4) factors extracted from TM satellite images as land cover and the vegetation index value. An advanced artificial neural network model has been used to analyze these factors in order to establish the landslide hazard map. The back-propagation training method has been used for the selection of the five different random training sites in order to calculate the factor's weight and then the landslide hazard indices were computed for each of the five hazard maps. Finally, the landslide hazard maps (five cases) were prepared using GIS tools. Results of the landslides hazard maps have been verified using landslide test locations that were not used during the training phase of the neural network. Our findings of verification results show an accuracy of 69\%, 75\%, 70\%, 83\% and 86\% for training sites 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 respectively. GIS data was used to efficiently analyze the large volume of data, and the artificial neural network proved to be an effective tool for landslide hazard analysis.

Landslide locations were identified and an inventory map was constructed by trained geomorphologists using photo-interpretation from archived aerial photographs supported by field surveys. A SPOT 5 satellite pan sharpened image acquired in January 2005 was used for land-cover classification supported by a topographic map. The above digitally processed images were subsequently combined in a GIS with ancillary data, for example topographical (slope, aspect, curvature, drainage), geological (litho types and lineaments), soil types, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data, and used to construct a spatial database using GIS and image processing. Three landslide hazard maps were constructed on the basis of landslide inventories and thematic layers, using frequency ratio, logistic regression, and artificial neural network models. Further, each thematic layer's weight was determined by the back-propagation training method and landslide hazard indices were calculated using the trained back-propagation weights. The results of the analysis were verified and compared using the landslide location data and the accuracy observed was 86.41, 89.59, and 83.55\% for frequency ratio, logistic regression, and artificial neural network models, respectively. On the basis of the higher percentages of landslide bodies predicted in very highly hazardous and highly hazardous zones, the results obtained by use of the logistic regression model were slightly more accurate than those from the other models used for landslide hazard analysis. The results from the neural network model suggest the effect of topographic slope is the highest and most important factor with weightage value (1.0), which is more than twice that of the other factors, followed by the NDVI (0.52), and then precipitation (0.42). Further, the results revealed that distance from lineament has the lowest weightage, with a value of 0. This shows that in the study area, fault lines and structural features do not contribute much to landslide triggering.},

  abstract = {Landslide-susceptibility mapping is one of the most critical issues in Malaysia. These landslides can be systematically assessed and mapped through a traditional mapping framework that uses geoinformation technologies (GIT). The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the possible application of an artificial neural network model and its cross-application of weights at three study areas in Malaysia, Penang Island, Cameron Highland and Selangor. Landslide locations were identified in the study areas from the interpretation of aerial photographs, field surveys and inventory reports. A landslide-related spatial database was constructed from topographic, soil, geology, and land-cover maps. For the calculation of the relative weight and importance of each factor to a particular landslide occurrence, an artificial neural network (ANN) method was applied. Landslide susceptibility was analyzed using the landslide occurrence factors provided by the artificial neural network model. Then, the landslide-susceptibility analysis results were validated and cross-validated using the landslide locations as study areas. Different training sites were randomly selected to train the neural network, and nine sets of landslide-susceptibility maps were prepared. The paper then illustrates the verification of those maps using an ``area under the curve'' (AUC) method. The verification results show that the case of the weight using the same test area showed slightly higher accuracy than the weight used for the cross-applied area. Among the three studied areas, the verification results showed similar accuracy trends while using the weight for the study area itself. Cameron showed the best accuracy and Penang showed the worst accuracy. Generally, the verification results showed satisfactory agreement between the susceptibility map and the existing data on the landslide location.},

  abstract = {Data collection for landslide susceptibility modeling is often an inhibitive activity. This is one reason why for quite some time landslides have been described and modelled on the basis of spatially distributed values of landslide-related attributes. This paper presents landslide susceptibility analysis in the Klang Valley area, Malaysia, using back-propagation artificial neural network model. A landslide inventory map with a total of 398 landslide locations was constructed using the data from various sources. Out of 398 landslide locations, 318 (80\%) of the data taken before the year 2004 was used for training the neural network model and the remaining 80 (20\%) locations (post-2004 events) were used for the accuracy assessment purpose. Topographical, geological data and satellite images were collected, processed, and constructed into a spatial database using GIS and image processing. Eleven landslide occurrence related factors were selected as: slope angle, slope aspect, curvature, altitude, distance to roads, distance to rivers, lithology, distance to faults, soil type, landcover and the normalized difference vegetation index value. For calculating the weight of the relative importance of each factor to the landslide occurrence, an artificial neural network method was developed. Each thematic layer's weight was determined by the back-propagation training method and landslide susceptibility indices (LSI) were calculated using the trained back-propagation weights. To assess the factor effects, the weights were calculated three times, using all 11 factors in the first case, then recalculating after removal of those 4 factors that had the smallest weights, and thirdly after removal of the remaining 3 least influential factors. The effect of weights in landslide susceptibility was verified using the landslide location data. It is revealed that all factors have relatively positive effects on the landslide susceptibility maps in the study. The validation results showed sufficient agreement between the computed susceptibility maps and the existing data on landslide areas. The distribution of landslide susceptibility zones derived from ANN shows similar trends as those obtained by applying in GIS-based susceptibility procedures by the same authors (using the frequency ratio and logistic regression method) and indicates that ANN results are better than the earlier method. Among the three cases, the best accuracy (94\%) was obtained in the case of the 7 factors weight, whereas 11 factors based weight showed the worst accuracy (91\%).},

This has been the reason that for quite some time landslide susceptibility analysis was modelled on the basis of spatially related factors. This paper presents the use of frequency ratio, fuzzy logic and multivariate regression models for landslide susceptibility mapping on Cameron catchment area, Malaysia, using a Geographic Information System (GIS) and remote sensing data. Landslide locations were identified in the study area from the interpretation of aerial photographs, high resolution satellite images, inventory reports and field surveys. Topographical, geological data and satellite images were collected, processed, and constructed into a spatial database using GIS and image processing tools. There were nine factors considered for landslide susceptibility mapping and the frequency ratio coefficient for each factor was computed. The factors chosen that influence landslide occurrence were: topographic slope, topographic aspect, topographic curvature and distance from drainage, all from the topographic database; lithology and distance from lineament, taken from the geologic database; land cover from TM satellite image; the vegetation index value from Landsat satellite images; and precipitation distribution from meteorological data. Using these factors the fuzzy membership values were calculated. Then fuzzy operators were applied to the fuzzy membership values for landslide susceptibility mapping. Further, multivariate logistic regression model was applied for the landslide susceptibility. Finally, the results of the analyses were verified using the landslide location data and compared with the frequency ratio, fuzzy logic and multivariate logistic regression models. The validation results showed that the frequency ratio model (accuracy is 89\%) is better in prediction than fuzzy logic (accuracy is 84\%) and logistic regression (accuracy is 85\%) models.

  abstract = {Landslides are very common natural problems in the Selangor area of Malaysia due to the improper use of landcover and tropical rainfall. There are many landslide susceptibility analyses such as statistical, bivariate and data mining approaches exist in the literature. This paper presents the use of fuzzy logic relations for landslide susceptibility mapping on part of Selangor area, Malaysia, using a Geographic Information System (GIS) and remote sensing data. At first, landslide locations were identified in the study area from the interpretation of aerial photographs and satellite images, supported by extensive field surveys. Topographic and geological data and satellite images were collected, processed, and constructed into a spatial database using GIS and image processing. Thirteen landslide conditioning factors such as slope gradient, slope exposure, plan curvature, altitude, stream power index, topographic wetness index, distance from drainage, distance from road, lithology, distance from faults, soil, landcover and normalized difference vegetation index (ndvi) were extracted from the spatial database. These factors were analyzed using fuzzy logic relations to produce the landslide susceptibility maps. Using the landslide conditioning factors and the identified landslides, the fuzzy membership values were calculated. Then fuzzy algebraic operators were applied to the fuzzy membership values for landslide susceptibility mapping. Finally, the ROC curves for all landslide susceptibility models were drawn and the area under curve values were calculated. Landslide locations were used to validate results of the landslide susceptibility maps and the validation results showed 94\% accuracy for the fuzzy gamma operator employing all parameters produced in the present study as the landslide conditioning factors. Results showed that, among the fuzzy relations, in the case in which the gamma operator ({$\lambda$} = 0.975) showed the best accuracy (94.73\%) while the case in which the fuzzy algebraic Or was applied showed the worst accuracy (84.76\%). The landslide susceptibility maps produced by the fuzzy gamma operators shows similar trends as those obtained by applying logistic regression procedure by the same author and indicate that fuzzy relations results perform slightly better than the earlier method. Qualitatively, the model yields reasonable results which can be used for preliminary land-use planning purposes.},

Maps of topography, soil type, lineaments and land cover were constructed from the spatial datasets. Ten factors which influence landslide occurrence, i.e., slope, aspect, curvature, distance from drainage, lithology, distance from lineaments, soil type, landcover, rainfall precipitation, and normalized difference vegetation index (ndvi), were extracted from the spatial database and the logistic regression coefficient of each factor was computed. Then the landslide hazard was analysed using the multivariate logistic regression coefficients derived not only from the data for the respective area but also using the logistic regression coefficients calculated from each of the other two areas (nine hazard maps in all) as a cross-validation of the model. For verification of the model, the results of the analyses were then compared with the field-verified landslide locations. Among the three cases of the application of logistic regression coefficient in the same study area, the case of Selangor based on the Selangor logistic regression coefficients showed the highest accuracy (94\%), where as Penang based on the Penang coefficients showed the lowest accuracy (86\%). Similarly, among the six cases from the cross application of logistic regression coefficient in other two areas, the case of Selangor based on logistic coefficient of Cameron showed highest (90\%) prediction accuracy where as the case of Penang based on the Selangor logistic regression coefficients showed the lowest accuracy (79\%). Qualitatively, the cross application model yields reasonable results which can be used for preliminary landslide hazard mapping.},

  abstract = {Dams are a major source of electricity globally, with hydropower generating 16 percent of the world's total electricity and 71 percent of all renewable electricity in 2016. Many developing countries possess great untapped hydropower potential. Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, is estimated to have tapped less than 8 percent of its hydropower potential. Proponents of dams praise them as a source of low-carbon electricity, estimated to reduce annual emissions by about 2.8 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. Dams also provide wide-ranging benefits in terms of flood control, irrigation, navigation, and job creation. But harnessing the power of the river comes with concentrated costs, from fragmenting the river system and destroying natural habitat to triggering ecological hazards and displacing millions of people. As the world is undergoing an energy system transformation toward renewable sources to combat climate change and meet emission reduction targets outlined in the Paris Agreement, understanding the costs and benefits of dam construction has important policy implications. In this project, the authors compiled a global geospatial database of dams, the Global Dam Tracker (GDAT), to enable rigorous research on the costs and benefits of dam construction. The project was motivated by the absence of a comprehensive, reliable, real-time, easy-to-use database on global dam construction. Such data could allow policymakers to make informed decisions on the use of hydroelectric power in the future, based on systematic evaluations of the costs and benefits of hydroelectric dams along the dimensions of energy access, climate change mitigation, water supply, ecological preservation, and population displacement.},

In this paper, an implementation of a simple approach to derive probabilistic earthquake triggered landslide hazard maps is described. The method is based on the simplified Newmark slope stability model, applied on a pixel-by-pixel basis, which fully integrates into current GIS computational environments. Uncertainties and fluctuations in input parameters are considered by treating these quantities as statistical distributions. Various probability density functions can be simulated through Monte Carlo techniques on a pixel-by-pixel basis, and the simulated samples are retained through all the computing steps. This allows the resulting quantities to be cast into probabilistic hazard maps, without restrictions about the symmetry or the mathematical complexity of the underlying distributions. First results on a test landslide site in Southern Italy show good performances for realistic landslide hazard zonation. The simplicity of the adopted framework allows the current approach to be easily expanded and improved the current approach.},

Over the years, this road section and its surrounding area have experienced repeated landslide activities. For that reason, landslide susceptibility zonation is essential for roadside slope disaster management and for planning further development activities. The main goal of this study was to investigate the application of the frequency ratio (FR), statistical index (SI), and weights-of-evidence (WoE) approaches for landslide susceptibility mapping of this road section and its surrounding area. For this purpose, the input layers of the landslide conditioning factors were prepared in the first stage. A landslide inventory map was prepared using earlier reports, aerial photographs interpretation, and multiple field surveys. A total of 438 landslide locations were detected. Out these, 295 (67 \%) landslides were randomly selected as training data for the modeling using FR, SI, and WoE models and the remaining 143 (33 \%) were used for the validation purposes. The landslide conditioning factors considered for the study area are slope gradient, slope aspect, plan curvature, altitude, stream power index, topographic wetness index, lithology, land use, distance from faults, distance from rivers, and distance from highway. The results were validated using area under the curve (AUC) analysis. From the analysis, it is seen that the FR model with a success rate of 76.8 \% and predictive accuracy of 75.4 \% performs better than WoE (success rate, 75.6 \%; predictive accuracy, 74.9 \%) and SI (success rate, 75.5 \%; predictive accuracy, 74.6 \%) models. Overall, all the models showed almost similar results. The resultant susceptibility maps can be useful for general land use planning.},

  abstract = {In the semiarid Southwestern USA, wildfires are commonly followed by runoff-generated debris flows because wildfires remove vegetation and ground cover, which reduces soil infiltration capacity and increases soil erodibility. At a study site in Southern California, we initially observed runoff-generated debris flows in the first year following fire. However, at the same site three years after the fire, the mass-wasting response to a long-duration rainstorm with high rainfall intensity peaks was shallow landsliding rather than runoff-generated debris flows. Moreover, the same storm caused landslides on unburned hillslopes as well as on slopes burned 5 years prior to the storm and areas burned by successive wildfires, 10 years and 3 years before the rainstorm. The landslide density was the highest on the hillslopes that had burned 3 years beforehand, and the hillslopes burned 5 years prior to the storm had low landslide densities, similar to unburned areas. We also found that reburning (i.e., two wildfires within the past 10 years) had little influence on landslide density. Our results indicate that landscape susceptibility to shallow landslides might return to that of unburned conditions after as little as 5 years of vegetation recovery. Moreover, most of the landslide activity was on steep, equatorial-facing slopes that receive higher solar radiation and had slower rates of vegetation regrowth, which further implicates vegetation as a controlling factor on post-fire landslide susceptibility. Finally, the total volume of sediment mobilized by the year 3 landslides was much smaller than the year 1 runoff-generated debris flows, and the landslides were orders of magnitude less mobile than the runoff-generated debris flows.},

  abstract = {Debris flows are a typical hazard on steep slopes after wildfire, but unlike debris flows that mobilize from landslides, most postwildfire debris flows are generated from water runoff. The majority of existing debris flow modeling has focused on landslide-triggered debris flows. In this study we explore the potential for using process-based rainfall-runoff models to simulate the timing of water flow and runoffgenerated debris flows in recently burned areas. Two different spatially distributed hydrologic models with differing levels of complexity were used: the full shallow water equations and the kinematic wave approximation. Model parameter values were calibrated in two different watersheds, spanning two orders of magnitude in drainage area. These watersheds were affected by the 2009 Station Fire in the San Gabriel Mountains, CA, USA. Input data for the numerical models were constrained by time series of soil moisture, flow stage, and rainfall collected at field sites, as well as high-resolution lidar-derived digital elevation models. The calibrated parameters were used to model a third watershed in the burn area, and the results show a good match with observed timing of flow peaks. The calibrated roughness parameter (Manning's n) was generally higher when using the kinematic wave approximation relative to the shallow water equations, and decreased with increasing spatial scale. The calibrated effective watershed hydraulic conductivity was low for both models, even for storms occurring several months after the fire, suggesting that wildfireinduced changes to soil-water infiltration were retained throughout that time. Overall, the two model simulations were quite similar suggesting that a kinematic wave model, which is simpler and more computationally efficient, is a suitable approach for predicting flood and debris flow timing in steep, burned watersheds.},

  abstract = {Predicting the timing of overland flow in burned watersheds can help to estimate debris-flow timing and the location of debris-flow initiation. Numerical models can produce flow predictions, but they are limited by our knowledge of appropriate model parameters. Moreover, opportunities to test and calibrate model parameters in post-wildfire settings are limited by available data (measurements of debris-flow timing are rare). In this study, we use a unique data set of rainfall and flow-timing data to test the extent to which model parameters can be generalized from an individual watershed to other watersheds (0.01 km 2 to {$>$}1km 2) within a burned area. Simulations suggest that a single, low, saturated hydraulic conductivity value can be used in post-wildfire landscapes with reasonable results. By contrast, we found that watershed-scale effective Manning roughness parameter values decrease as a power-law function of basin drainage area. Thus a Manning roughness parameter calibrated for a single basin within a burned area may not provide adequate results in a different watershed. However, when flow velocity is modeled independently for hillslopes and channels, and different roughness parameters are used for those morphometric units, there is no drainage-area dependence on the roughness parameters. Moreover, we found that it was possible to use field-measured grain size data to parameterize the roughness for both hillslopes and channels. Thus our results show that, employing this generalizable approach, it is possible to use field measurements to fully parameterize a model that produces peak flow timing to within a few minutes in storms lasting several hours. Further, we demonstrate how model simulations can be leveraged to identify areas within a watershed that are most susceptible to debris flows. This modeling approach could be used for decision making in hazardous burned areas and would be especially useful in ungaged basins. \textcopyright{} 2019 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In this model, seismic slope stability is measured in terms of critical acceleration, which depends on the mechanical soil properties, pore-pressure distribution, and slope geometry. The triggering seismic forces are investigated in terms of energy radiation from the source, propagation, and site effects, based on 190 accelerometric recordings from 17 Italian earthquakes with magnitudes between 4.5 and 6.8. The method is based on the calibration of relations having the general form of an attenuation law that relates the energy of the seismic forces to the dynamic shear resistances of the sliding mass to propagate the expected landslide displacements as an inverse function of the distance from the fault rupture; the amount of displacement computed through these relations provides a criterion to predict the occurrence of slope failures. Finally, maps showing, in a deterministic and a probabilistic way, the potential of seismically induced landslide displacements are displayed as a tool to provide seismic landslide scenarios and earthquake-induced landslide hazard maps, respectively.},

We then analyze the statistical distributions of both rainfall data types and the rainfall events derived from them. Results show that satellite data underestimates ground data, with the largest differences in mountainous areas. Power-law models, are more appropriate to correlate gauge and satellite data. The gauge and satellite-based products exhibit different statistical distributions and the rainfall events derived from them differ. In conclusion, satellite rainfall cannot be directly compared with ground data, requiring local investigation to account for specific morpho-climatological settings.

These systems are based on empirical rainfall thresholds defined using rain gauges data. Despite quantitative satellite rainfall estimates are currently available, limited research has compared satellite estimates and rain gauge measurements for the forecasting of possible landslide occurrence. In this work, we validate satellite estimates obtained for Italy by the NASA Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) against rainfall measurements from the Italian rain gauge network ({$>$} 1950 rain gauges), in the period from 1 September 2009 to 31 August 2010. Using cumulative rainfall measurements/estimates, we: (i) evaluate the correlation between the rain gauge measurements and the satellite estimates in different morpho-climatological domains, (ii) analyse the distributions of the ground-based measurements and the satellite estimates using different statistical approaches, and (iii) compare rainfall events derived automatically from satellite and rain gauge rainfall series. We observe differences between satellite estimates and rain gauge measurements in different morpho-climatological domains. The differences are larger in mountain areas, and collectively reveal a complex relationship between the ground-based measurements and the satellite estimates. We find that a power law correlation model is appropriate to describe the relation between the two rainfall data series. We conclude that specific rainfall thresholds must be defined to exploit satellite rainfall estimates in existing landslide early warning systems.},

  abstract = {Hazards are an inherent but dangerous and costly element of mountainous environments. Conventional maps of mountain hazards provide useful inventories of hazardous sites but provide little insight into the operation of the hazards. Furthermore, this approach tends to rely heavily on subjective interpretation of the landscape, which means that the results can not be replicated or transferred to other areas. Thus, alternative approaches employing the quantitative capabilities of geographic information systems (GIS) to model and predict slope stability are receiving increasing attention. This paper reports on the use of a diverse GIS database, compiled primarily from existing maps and aerial photographs, to construct a regional model of slope stability in Phewa Tal watershed, Nepal. An integral part of the research was to explore an alternative approach to the commonly used grid cell approach by employing geomorphometrically significant terrain units. The terrain units employed were created by generating line networks representing local maxima and minima extracted from elevation and curvature surfaces. One of the chief benefits of applying GIS technology in this research was the ability to georeference all of the attribute data to these terrain units. In doing so, it allowed the database to be exported into an external statistical package, where the terrain units could be statistically explored as the basic analytical unit. The application of a variety of statistical techniques resulted in logistic regression being selected as the most useful. Logistic regression successfully predicted terrain units as being either stable or unstable at a rate of approximately 90\% concordance with a conventionally produced map of slope stability. The statistical probabilities of terrain unit stability were imported back into the GIS to produce a map of predicted slope stability that compared well with the conventional map of slope stability. The findings of this research suggest that the use of geomorphometrically significant terrain units extracted from a digital elevation model (DEM) are an efficient alternative to approaches using regular grid cells. In particular, the terrain units facilitated the use of logistic regression, and significantly decreased the amount of computing costs. Finally, this research also suggests that important information can be gathered from existing information sources, such as maps, aerial photographs, and written documents, thereby limiting the need for costly and time consuming field work at the reconnaissance level. Based on this latter finding, other information sources, such as satellite imagery, should be examined.},

  abstract = {To manage the hazard associated with shallow landslides, decision makers need an understanding of where and when landslides may occur. A variety of approaches have been used to estimate the hazard from shallow, rainfall-triggered landslides, such as empirical rainfall threshold methods or probabilistic methods based on historical records. The wide availability of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and digital topographic data has led to the development of analytic methods for landslide hazard estimation that couple steady-state hydrological models with slope stability calculations. Because these methods typically neglect the transient effects of infiltration on slope stability, results cannot be linked with historical or forecasted rainfall sequences. Estimates of the frequency of conditions likely to cause landslides are critical for quantitative risk and hazard assessments. We present results to demonstrate how a transient infiltration model coupled with an infinite slope stability calculation may be used to assess shallow landslide frequency in the City of Seattle, Washington, USA. A module called CRF (Critical RainFall) for estimating deterministic rainfall thresholds has been integrated in the TRIGRS (Transient Rainfall Infiltration and Grid-based Slope-Stability) model that combines a transient, one-dimensional analytic solution for pore-pressure response to rainfall infiltration with an infinite slope stability calculation. Input data for the extended model include topographic slope, colluvial thickness, initial water-table depth, material properties, and rainfall durations. This approach is combined with a statistical treatment of rainfall using a GEV (General Extreme Value) probabilistic distribution to produce maps showing the shallow landslide recurrence induced, on a spatially distributed basis, as a function of rainfall duration and hillslope characteristics.},

The susceptibility assessment is based on multivariate statistical techniques (discriminant analysis), which hasbeen tested in a pilot area in La Pobla de Lillet (Eastern Pyreenes, Spain). Theresults obtained using a random sample show that 82\% of all the cells, and 90\% of cells including slope failures, have been properly classified. A susceptibility map based on the discriminant function has given consistent results. The susceptibilityassessment is very sensitive to the parameters selected. Compared to thetraditional methods, the main advantage of the GIS-aided procedure is the rapidityprovided by the automatic capture of parameters. It also has the capability of coveringlarge areas, and the objectivity and reproducibility of the results. The main drawbackis that, at present, not all regions have DEM accurate enough to cope with small landslides.},

  abstract = {The vulnerability of recently burned areas to debris flows has been well established. Likewise, it has been shown that many, if not most, post-fire debris flows are initiated by runoff and erosion and grow in size through erosion and scour by the moving debris flow, as opposed to landslide-initiated flows with little growth. To better understand the development and character of these flows, a study has been completed encompassing 46 debris flows in California, Utah, and Colorado, in nine different recently burned areas. For each debris flow, progressive debris production was measured at intervals along the length of the channel, and from these measurements graphs were developed showing cumulative volume of debris as a function of channel length. All 46 debris flows showed significant bulking by scour and erosion, with average yield rates for each channel ranging from 0.3 to 9.9~m3 of debris produced for every meter of channel length, with an overall average value of 2.5~m3/m. Significant increases in yield rate partway down the channel were identified in 87\% of the channels, with an average of a three-fold increase in yield rate. Yield rates for short reaches of channels (up to several hundred meters) ranged as high as 22.3~m3/m. Debris was contributed from side channels into the main channels for 54\% of the flows, with an average of 23\% of the total debris coming from those side channels. Rill erosion was identified for 30\% of the flows, with rills contributing between 0.1 and 10.5\% of the total debris, with an average of 3\%. Debris was deposited as levees in 87\% of the flows, with most of the deposition occurring in the lower part of the basin. A median value of 10\% of the total debris flow was deposited as levees for these cases, with a range from near zero to nearly 100\%. These results show that channel erosion and scour are the dominant sources of debris in burned areas, with yield rates increasing significantly partway down the channel. Side channels are much more important sources of debris than rills. Levees are very common, but the size and effect on the amount of debris that reaches a canyon mouth is highly variable.},

Six important causative factors for landslide occurrences were selected and corresponding thematic data layers were prepared in GIS.

Numerical weights for different categories of these factors were determined based on a statistical approach and the weighted thematic layers were integrated in GIS environment to generate the landslide susceptibility map of the area. The landslide susceptibility map classifies the area into five different landslide susceptible zones i.e., very high, high, moderate, low and very low. This map was validated using the existing landslide distribution in the area.},

Detailed field investigation was performed on these two landslides. To examine the triggering and movement mechanisms, samples were taken from these two landslides. By using a ring shear apparatus, real earthquake wave loading test and cyclic loading tests were performed on these samples. The test results revealed that those sand samples from both landslides can suffer from sliding surface liquefaction phenomenon with very low final apparent friction angles, while the silt sample from Terano landslide showed no liquefaction failure, indicating that the sliding surfaces of these rapid landslides must have been formed within the sand layer in the past landslide masses.},

  abstract = {Hydrologic analyses often involve the evaluation of soil water infiltration, conductivity, storage, and plant-water relationships. To define the hydrologic soil water effects requires estimating soil water characteristics for water potential and hydraulic conductivity using soil variables such as texture, organic matter (OM), and structure. Field or laboratory measurements are difficult, costly, and often impractical for many hydrologic analyses. Statistical correlations between soil texture, soil water potential, and hydraulic conductivity can provide estimates sufficiently accurate for many analyses and decisions. This study developed new soil water characteristic equations from the currently available USDA soil database using only the readily available variables of soil texture and OM. These equations are similar to those previously reported by Saxton et al. but include more variables and application range. They were combined with previously reported relationships for tensions and conductivities and the effects of density, gravel, and salinity to form a comprehensive predictive system of soil water characteristics for agricultural water management and hydrologic analyses. Verification was performed using independent data sets for a wide range of soil textures. The predictive system was programmed for a graphical computerized model to provide easy application and rapid solutions and is available at http://hydrolab.arsusda.gov/soilwater/Index.htm},

  abstract = {The multiple-agency/university North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) project is designed to provide enhanced soil and temperature initial conditions for numerical weather/climate prediction models. Currently, four land surface models (LSMs) are running in NLDAS both in retrospective mode and in real-time mode. All LSMs are driven by the same meteorologic forcing data and are initiated at the same time with the same relative soil wetness. This study intercompares these NLDAS soil moisture fields with each other and with available observations. The total water storage and the storage variability range are the foci of the study. The mean statistical properties and the spatial variation of these soil moisture fields along with their temporal change are investigated. Model soil moisture fields are compared to soil moisture observations in Illinois. The storage variability range in Arkansas-Red River basin is validated against a water balance diagnostic analysis using historical precipitation and streamflow data. There is better agreement between observed and simulated ranges of water storage variability than between observed and simulated amounts of total water storage. Significant differences are found between NLDAS-simulated soil moisture fields from the different models. Total water storage is found to be highly model dependent. There is better agreement between models in the water total water storage range than in the model values of total water storage. Total water storage ranges agree best in humid areas where variation in water storage is strongly driven by variation in precipitation. In very dry areas, agreement between simulated water storage ranges is weak because model differences have as much influence on water storage range as climate variability in these areas. Finally, the spin-up properties of the models and relationships between water storage properties and climate are investigated. The results of this study should provide important insights into the similarities and differences of the four LSMs in NLDAS. Differences in NLDAS soil moisture fields pose challenges to land surface modelers who intend to use soil moisture field from one model to initialize another model.},

  abstract = {The purpose of the present paper is to manifest the results of the neuro-fuzzy model using remote sensing data and GIS for landslide susceptibility analysis in a part of the Klang Valley areas i Malaysia. Landslide locations in the study area were identified by interpreting aerial photographs and satellite images, supported by extensive field surveys. SPOT 5 satellite imagery was used to map vegetation index. Maps of topography, lineaments, NDVI and land cover were constructed from the spatial datasets. Seven landslide conditioning factors such as altitude, slope angle, plan curvature, distance from drainage, soil type, distance from faults and NDVI were extracted from the spatial database. These factors were analyzed using a neuro-fuzzy model (adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, ANFIS) to construct the landslide susceptibility maps. During the model development works, total 5 landslide susceptibility models were obtained by using ANFIS results. For verification, the results of the analyses were then compared with the field-verified landslide locations. Additionally, the ROC curves for all landslide susceptibility models were drawn and the area under curve values was calculated. Landslide locations were used to validate results of the landslide susceptibility map and the verification results showed 98\% accuracy for the model 5 employing all parameters produced in the present study as the landslide conditioning factors. The validation results showed sufficient agreement between the obtained susceptibility map and the existing data on landslide areas. Qualitatively, the model yields reasonable results which can be used for preliminary landuse planning purposes. As a conclusion, the ANFIS is a very useful tool for regional landslide susceptibility assessments.},

  abstract = {Wildfire can lead to considerable hydrological and geomorphological change, both directly by weathering bedrock surfaces and changing soil structure and properties, and indirectly through the effects of changes to the soil and vegetation on hydrological and geomorphological processes. This review summarizes current knowledge and identifies research gaps focusing particularly on the contribution of research from the Mediterranean Basin, Australia and South Africa over the last two decades or so to the state of knowledge mostly built on research carried out in the USA. Wildfire-induced weathering rates have been reported to be high relative to other weathering processes in fire-prone terrain, possibly as much as one or two magnitudes higher than frost action, with important implications for cosmogenic-isotope dating of the length of rock exposure. Wildfire impacts on soil properties have been a major focus of interest over the last two decades. Fire usually reduces soil aggregate stability and can induce, enhance or destroy soil water repellency depending on the temperature reached and its duration. These changes have implications for infiltration, overland flow and rainsplash detachment. A large proportion of publications concerned with fire impacts have focused on post-fire soil erosion by water, particularly at small scales. These have shown elevated, sometimes extremely large post-fire losses before geomorphological stability is re-established. Soil losses per unit area are generally negatively related to measurement scale reflecting increased opportunities for sediment storage at larger scales. Over the last 20 years, there has been much improvement in the understanding of the forms, causes and timing of debris flow and landslide activity on burnt terrain. Advances in previously largely unreported processes (e.g. bio-transfer of sediment and wind erosion) have also been made. Post-fire hydrological effects have generally also been studied at small rather than large scales, with soil water repellency effects on infiltration and overland flow being a particular focus. At catchment scales, post-fire accentuated peakflow has received more attention than changes in total flow, reflecting easier measurement and the greater hazard posed by the former. Post-fire changes to stream channels occur over both short and long terms with complex feedback mechanisms, though research to date has been limited. Research gaps identified include the need to: (1) develop a fire severity index relevant to soil changes rather than to degree of biomass destruction; (2) isolate the hydrological and geomorphological impacts of fire-induced soil water repellency changes from other important post-fire changes (e.g. litter and vegetation destruction); (3) improve knowledge of the hydrological and geomorphological impacts of wildfire in a wider range of fire-prone terrain types; (4) solve important problems in the determination and analysis of hillslope and catchment sediment yields including poor knowledge about soil losses other than at small spatial and short temporal scales, the lack of a clear measure of the degradational significance of post-fire soil losses, and confusion arising from errors in and lack of scale context for many quoted post-fire soil erosion rates; and (5) increase the research effort into past and potential future hydrological and geomorphological changes resulting from wildfire.},

This paper discusses wildfire impacts in such a wet Mediterranean environment on soil hydrophobicity, infiltration capacity, overland flow coefficients, soil loss, rainsplash detachment and small-scale ground level changes for Eucalyptus globulus and Pinus pinaster forest: (1) 0-2 years after fire ('new' burn); (2) 3-4 years after fire ('old' burn); and (3) 'mature' (or long unburnt) sites. For 'new' burn sites, rainsplash detachment rates are an order of magnitude and soil losses two orders of magnitude higher than for 'old' burn sites and both are two orders of magnitude higher than for 'mature' sites. Soils are hydrophobic in all three categories of sites, but infiltration capacities are lower at 'new' burn and 'old' burn than at 'mature' sites. Overland flow coefficients on long unburnt sites were low while on burnt sites they were high and tended to be higher for summer and autumn than for winter and spring, implying enhanced hydrophobicity under summer drought conditions, causing decreased infiltration capacity and increased overland flow. The distinctiveness of fire effects on soil erosion and hydrology in this wet Mediterranean environment and implications for post-fire management are discussed.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study is to analyze variability in rainfall threshold for debris flow (critical rainfall for debris flow triggering) after the ML 7.3 Chi-Chi earthquake in central Taiwan in 1999. Two study sites with different geological conditions were surveyed in the earthquake area. Streambed surveys were conducted to continuously monitor debris flows between 1999 and 2006. During the 7-year study period, every debris flow event was identified, and the streambed characterized. Results show that the rainfall threshold for debris flow was remarkably lower just after the Chi-Chi Earthquake, but gradually recovered. To date, this rainfall threshold is still lower than the original level prior to the earthquake. This variability in rainfall threshold is closely related to the amount of sediment material in the initiation area of debris flow, which increased rapidly due to landslides resulting from the earthquake. With the increase in sediment material, the rainfall threshold was lowered severely during the first year following the Chi-Chi earthquake. However, heavy rainfalls mobilized the sediment material, causing debris flows and transporting sediment downstream. With the decrease in sediment material, the rainfall threshold recovered gradually over time. Furthermore, debris flows occurred only in the subbasins that had sufficient sediment material to cause significant movement. Hence, these results confirm that the sediment material in the initiation area of debris flow is a crucial component of the rainfall threshold for debris flow.},

The Chi-Chi earthquake triggered landslide on the dip slope at the Chiufengershan. In this study, a review of the topography and geology of this area was followed by field investigations. Laboratory testing was applied to understand the geomaterial composing the slope. Then, based on a series of limit equilibrium analyses, the failure mechanism of this landslide and the risk of the residual slope were studied. According to the stability analyses, the pre-quake slope is quite stable, with factor of safety of 1.77 (dry) to 1.35 (full groundwater level); explaining why there is no written record of a landslide here for the past 100 years. In contrast, a back analysis shows that the Chi-Chi earthquake-induced dynamic loading is far more than the dip slope can sustain, due in part to the short distance to the epicenter. A Monte Carlo type probability analysis suggests that the residual slope is more dangerous than the pre-quake slope and needs more attention.},

In addition, mechanical properties of the geomaterials were considered as random variables instead of single values; slope sections and groundwater levels were also randomly adopted. Through a Monte Carlo sampling process, a distribution of safety factor and probability of failure were determined. This approach was applied to hazard assessment of the Li-shan landslide in Central Taiwan. Through a series of analyses, the hazards of sliding bodies of the Li-shan landslide were estimated and ranked. It shows the influence of ground water level is significant, which reveals the importance of ground water control and monitoring. The results show the safety of the northeast and southeast areas of the landslide have been significantly improved since the ground water levels have been lowered by the drainage system.

All the information was inserted into a Geographic Information Systems. Clustering (Dendrogram and k-means) and Statistical (Principal Component Analysis and Correlation) techniques were used to regionalize the rain data and select the rain gauges to be input on Artificial Neural Networks , which were used to replace the missing rain values. The landslide volume variable also presented missing values and it was completed by the k-Nearest Neighbor method.

In this report, empirical models are used to predict the probability and magnitude of debris-flow occurrence in response to a 10-year rainstorm for the 2013 Rim fire in Yosemite National Park and the Stanislaus National Forest, California. Overall, the models predict a relatively high probability (60\textendash 80 percent) of debris flow for 28 of the 1,238 drainage basins in the burn area in response to a 10-year recurrence interval design storm. Predictions of debris-flow volume suggest that debris flows may entrain a significant volume of material, with 901 of the 1,238 basins identified as having potential debris-flow volumes greater than 10,000 cubic meters. These results of the relative combined hazard analysis suggest there is a moderate likelihood of significant debris-flow hazard within and downstream of the burn area for nearby populations, infrastructure, wildlife, and water resources. Given these findings, we recommend that residents, emergency managers, and public works departments pay close attention to weather forecasts and National-Weather-Service-issued Debris Flow and Flash Flood Outlooks, Watches and Warnings and that residents adhere to any evacuation orders.},

  abstract = {Rainfall intensity\textendash duration (ID) thresholds are commonly used to predict the temporal occurrence of debris flows and shallow landslides. Typically, thresholds are subjectively defined as the upper limit of peak rainstorm intensities that do not produce debris flows and landslides, or as the lower limit of peak rainstorm intensities that initiate debris flows and landslides. In addition, peak rainstorm intensities are often used to define thresholds, as data regarding the precise timing of debris flows and associated rainfall intensities are usually not available, and rainfall characteristics are often estimated from distant gauging locations. Here, we attempt to improve the performance of existing threshold-based predictions of post-fire debris-flow occurrence by utilizing data on the precise timing of debris flows relative to rainfall intensity, and develop an objective method to define the threshold intensities. We objectively defined the thresholds by maximizing the number of correct predictions of debris flow occurrence while minimizing the rate of both Type I (false positive) and Type II (false negative) errors. We identified that (1) there were statistically significant differences between peak storm and triggering intensities, (2) the objectively defined threshold model presents a better balance between predictive success, false alarms and failed alarms than previous subjectively defined thresholds, (3) thresholds based on measurements of rainfall intensity over shorter duration ({$\leq$}60 min) are better predictors of post-fire debris-flow initiation than longer duration thresholds, and (4) the objectively defined thresholds were exceeded prior to the recorded time of debris flow at frequencies similar to or better than subjective thresholds. Our findings highlight the need to better constrain the timing and processes of initiation of landslides and debris flows for future threshold studies. In addition, the methods used to define rainfall thresholds in this study represent a computationally simple means of deriving critical values for other studies of nonlinear phenomena characterized by thresholds.},

The magnitude of annual precipitation estimates over global land deviated by as much as 300 mm/yr among the products. Reanalysis data sets had a larger degree of variability than the other types of data sets. The degree of variability in precipitation estimates also varied by region. Large differences in annual and seasonal estimates were found in tropical oceans, complex mountain areas, northern Africa, and some high-latitude regions. Overall, the variability associated with extreme precipitation estimates was slightly greater at lower latitudes than at higher latitudes. The reliability of precipitation data sets is mainly limited by the number and spatial coverage of surface stations, the satellite algorithms, and the data assimilation models. The inconsistencies described limit the capability of the products for climate monitoring, attribution, and model validation.},

The primary source of information in climate change impact studies is climate model projections. However, due to the coarse resolution and biases of these models, they cannot be directly used in hydrological models. Hence, statistical downscaling is necessary to address climate change impacts at the catchment scale. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} This study compares eight statistical downscaling methods (SDMs) often used in climate change impact studies. Four methods are based on change factors (CFs), three are bias correction (BC) methods, and one is a perfect prognosis method. The eight methods are used to downscale precipitation output from 15 regional climate models (RCMs) from the ENSEMBLES project for 11 catchments in Europe. The overall results point to an increase in extreme precipitation in most catchments in both winter and summer. For individual catchments, the downscaled time series tend to agree on the direction of the change but differ in the magnitude. Differences between the SDMs vary between the catchments and depend on the season analysed. Similarly, general conclusions cannot be drawn regarding the differences between CFs and BC methods. The performance of the BC methods during the control period also depends on the catchment, but in most cases they represent an improvement compared to RCM outputs. Analysis of the variance in the ensemble of RCMs and SDMs indicates that at least 30\% and up to approximately half of the total variance is derived from the SDMs. This study illustrates the large variability in the expected changes in extreme precipitation and highlights the need for considering an ensemble of both SDMs and climate models. Recommendations are provided for the selection of the most suitable SDMs to include in the analysis.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {In the last decades, landslide hazard assessment has attracted many researchers' attention. A number of parameters are suggested to be responsible to quantitatively explain the mechanism of landslides; many of these parameters are very important and factual. However, some data types and models are site-specific and could not be applied to different locations. Furthermore, the data stored in continuous parameter maps are divided into a number of classes arbitrarily, depending on the vision of the expert. Basically, this division controls the result of bivariate analysis. Besides, the responsible portion of the parameter map controlling the mechanism is also weighted arbitrarily. Based on these two facts, the class boundaries put a prejudice on the produced susceptibility/hazard maps, which result in dependence on the knowledge of the user rather than being dependent on the data and the fact itself. The aim of this study is to refine the previously defined methods in a more data-dependent trend. To achieve this goal, two new concepts: seed cells and percentile maps are introduced. Seed cells are the zones that are considered to represent the best undisturbed morphological decision rules (conditions before landslide occurs) and would be achieved by adding a buffer zone to the crown and flank areas of the landslide. To quantitatively classify the input parameter maps, the data distributions of seed cells in the parameter maps are divided into a number of classes on the basis of their distribution's percentile break-points upon which the parameter maps are directly dependent on the seed cell distributions, hence to the data itself.},

  abstract = {Landslide can be triggered by intense or prolonged rainfall. Precipitation data obtained from ground-based observation is very accurate and commonly used to do analysis and landslide prediction. However, this approach is costly with its own limitation due to lack of density of ground station, especially in mountain area. As an alternative, satellite derived rainfall techniques have become more favorable to overcome these limitations. Moreover, the satellite derived rainfall estimation needs to be validated on its accuracy and its capability to predict landslide which presumably triggered by rainfall. This paper presents the investigation of using the TRMM-3B42V7 data in comparison to the available rain-gauge data in Ulu Kelang, Selangor. The monthly average rainfall, cumulative rainfall and rainfall threshold analysis from 1998 to 2011 is compared using quantitative statistical criteria (Pearson correlation, bias, root mean square error, mean different and mean). The results from analysis showed that there is a significant and strong positive correlation between the TRMM 3B42V7 and rain gauge data. The threshold derivative from the satellite products is lower than the rain gauge measurement. The findings indicated that the proposed method can be applied using TRMM satellite estimates products to derive rainfall threshold for the possible landslide occurrence.},

Here, we derive thresholds for the initiation of runoff-generated debris flows based on critical values of dimensionless discharge and Shields stress. These thresholds are derived by using a numerical model to estimate the hydrodynamic conditions coinciding with the timing of debris flow activity in a recently burned basin. A benefit of hydrodynamic thresholds is that they can be used to assess debris flow likelihood based on measurable hydrologic and geomorphic parameters and therefore provide more universal criteria for quantifying the runoff-to-debris flow transition in landscape evolution studies and hazard assessments. We then demonstrate how hydrodynamic thresholds can be used to estimate rainfall intensity-duration thresholds for runoff-generated debris flows without the need for historic debris flow observations.},

The factor maps were input into a GIS and a modified landslide hazard evaluation factor (MLHEF) rating and fuzzy membership functions as well as belief function values were assessed for each class of the factor maps. The fuzzy sum, product and gamma combination approaches were examined and output maps were assessed based on the known landslides. The outputs of fuzzy sum and product combination rules were not reasonable because these approaches classified the area into 'very-high' or 'very low' susceptibility zones respectively, which were not compatible to the field and factor maps criteria. A {$\gamma$} value of 0.94 yielded the most reliable susceptibility for landslides. Overlay of the known landslides with the output favorability map showed that the identified landslides were located in the high- and very-high susceptible zones. The output results of the Dempster\textendash Shafer model: plausibility, belief, and uncertainty images were also evaluated based on the known landslides. The results of this approach revealed that although it was expected that most of the known landslides correspond the plausibility, or the belief map, only a few of them supported the case, and some landslides were coincided into the disbelief, or uncertainty maps. It is concluded that in comparison to the fuzzy model, the D\textendash S model obtains less reliable results for landslide hazard mapping. Since the belief functions were assigned based on the fuzzy membership functions this might be due to the integration equations used by the model, or the number of evidence maps used as input layers.},

  abstract = {Digital elevation models (DEMs) are a useful data source for the automatic delineation of flow paths, sub watersheds and flow networks for hydrologic modeling. Digital representation of the flow network is central to distributed hydrologic models because it encodes the model element linkages through which flow is routed to the outlet. The scale (drainage density) of the flow network, used controls the scale of hillslope and channel model elements. Although field mapping is acknowledged as the most accurate way to determine channel networks and drainage density, it is often impractical, especially for large watersheds, and DEM derived flow networks then provide a useful surrogate for channel or valley networks. There are a variety of approaches to delineating flow networks, using different algorithms such as single (drainage to a single neighboring cell) and multiple (partitioning of flow between multiple neighboring cells) flow direction methods for the computation of contributing area and local identification of upwards curvature. The scale of the delineated network is sometimes controlled by a support area threshold, which may impose an arbitrary and spatially constant drainage density. This paper examines methods for the delineation of flow networks using grid DEMs. We examine the question of objective estimation of drainage density and describe a method based on terrain curvature that can accommodate spatially variable drainage density. The methods presented have been incorporated as a component of the TMDL Toolkit software developed to support hydrologic and water quality modeling and available from http://www.engineering.usu.edu/dtarb/.},

  abstract = {A landslide occurs when the balance between a hill's weight and the countering resistance forces is tipped in favor of gravity. While the physics governing the interplay between these competing forces is fairly well understood, prediction of landslides has been hindered thus far by the lack of field measurements over large temporal and spatial scales necessary to capture the inherent heterogeneity in a landslide.We propose a network of sensor columns deployed at hills with landslide potential with the purpose of detecting the early signals preceding a catastrophic event. Detection is performed through a three-stage algorithm: First, sensors collectively detect small movements consistent with the formation of a slip surface separating the sliding part of hill from the static one. Once the sensors agree on the presence of such a surface, they conduct a distributed votingalgorithm to separate the subset of sensors that moved from the static ones. In the second phase, moved sensors self-localize through a trilateration mechanism and their displacements are calculated. Finally, the direction of the displacements as well as the locations of the moved nodes are used to estimate the position of the slip surface. This information along with collected soil measurements e.g. soil pore pressures) are subsequently passed to a Finite Element Model that predicts whether and when a landslide will occur.Our initial results from simulated landslides indicate that we can achieve accuracy in the order of cm in the localization as well as the slip surface estimation steps of our algorithm. This accuracy persists as the density and the size of the sensor network decreases as well as when considerable noise is present in the ranging estimates. As for our next step, we plan to evaluate the performance of our system in controlled environments under a variety of hill configurations.},

The landslide inventory was then randomly partitioned into 70\% for training the models and 30\% for the model validation. Second, ten landslide conditioning factors were selected (i.e., slope angle, slope aspect, relief amplitude, lithology, soil type, land use, distance to roads, distance to rivers, distance to faults, and rainfall). Using these factors, landslide susceptibility indexes were calculated using SVM, DT, and NB models. Finally, landslide locations that were not used in the training phase were used to validate and compare the landslide susceptibility maps. The validation results show that the models derived using SVM have the highest prediction capability. The model derived using DT has the lowest prediction capability. Compared to the logistic regression model, the prediction capability of the SVM models is slightly better. The prediction capability of the DT and NB models is lower.},

  abstract = {Using observations from 688 debris flows, we analyse the hydrologic and landscape characteristics that influenced debris-flow initiation mechanisms and locations in a watershed that had been partially burned by the 2012 Whitewater-Baldy Complex Fire in the Gila Mountains, southern New Mexico. Debris flows can initiate due to different processes. Slopes can fail as discrete landslides and then become fluidized and move downstream as debris flows (landslide initiated) or progressive bulking of sediment from a distributed area can become channelized and concentrated as it moves downslope (runoff generated). In this study, we have an unusual opportunity to investigate both types of debris-flow initiation mechanisms in our observations of debris flows, triggered by an exceptional rainstorm in the autumn of 2013. Additionally, we compare our observations with those of a dataset of 1138 debris flows in the Colorado Front Range, triggered during the same weather system. We found that runoff-generated debris flows dominated in burn areas, and runoff required to start these flows could be well characterized by the Shields stress. Landslide-initiated debris flows were dominant in unburned areas. Debris-flow densities were tied to total rainfall and precipitation intensities. Like the observations in the Colorado Front Range, debris-flow initiation locations were found primarily in areas of relatively sparse vegetation on south-facing slopes between 25 and 40\textdegree, and with upslope contributing areas less than 1000 m2. In terms of preferential locations for debris-flow initiations, 2013 vegetation coverage, approximated by Green\textendash Red Vegetation Index metrics, proved to be more influential than the 2012 burn-severity designation. The uniformity of observations between our study area and those in the Colorado Front Range indicate that the underlying hydrologic and landscape patterns of the debris-flow initiation locations documented in these studies could be applicable to the wider southwest and Rocky Mountain regions.

  abstract = {Accurate estimates of local changes in extreme precipitation are valuable for informing local policy decisions and estimating potential impacts on areas such as health, infrastructure, ecosystems and agriculture. To bridge the gap between the coarse spatial resolution of climate model output and the need for weather and climate information at a higher resolution, downscaling methods have been developed. This research compares several different downscaling methods in their ability to simulate rainfall extremes over the Northeastern United States. The methods compared are a bias-correction and spatial disaggregation technique, the statistical downscaling model (SDSM) and a regional climate model, HadRM3. Validation was done using generalized extreme value (GEV) distributions of annual maxima and return-period estimates. All the different techniques simulated reasonable estimates of extreme rainfall across the northeast. However, the agreement of simulations with observations depended upon the downscaling technique used and the location. The SDSM simulations matched observed extreme climatology the best. HadRM3 tended to overestimate mean precipitation and gave a GEV distribution that did not replicate the observed distribution well and, thus, overestimated the extremes. We then developed high-resolution projections of future changes to rainfall across the Northeast United States, using IPCC SRES emission scenario A2 combined with these downscaling methods. Future projections based on SDSM indicate increases in the magnitude of extreme rainfall events by {$\sim$}7\% through the 2041\textendash 2060 period with considerable regional variation particularly at the higher 50- and 100-year return periods. However, these projected increases rarely fall outside the 95\% confidence intervals based on the observation period from 1961 to 1980. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2010 Royal Meteorological Society},

However, among the techniques, artificial neural networks are relatively new approach used in engineering geology in particular. The attractiveness of ANN for the engineering geological problems comes from the information processing characteristics of the system, such as non-linearity, high parallelism, robustness, fault and failure tolerance, learning, ability to handle imprecise and fuzzy information, and their capability to generalize. For this reason, the purposes of the present study are to perform an application of ANN to a engineering geology problem having a very large database and to introduce a new approach to accelerate convergence. For these purposes, an ANN architecture having 5 neurons in one hidden layer was constructed. During the training stages, total 40 000 training cycles were performed and the minimum RMSE values were obtained at approximately 10 000th cycle. At this cycle, the obtained minimum RMSE value is 0.22 for the second training set, while that of value is calculated as 0.064 again for the second test set. Using the trained ANN model at 10 000th cycle for the second random sampling, the debris source area susceptibility map was produced and adjusted. Finally, a potential debris source susceptibility map for the study area was produced. When considering the field observations and existing inventory map, the produced map has a high prediction capacity and it can be used when assessing debris flow hazard mitigation efforts.},

In this study, in order to achieve this goal, extensive field observations to identify the areal extent of debris source areas and debris material, air-photo studies to determine the debris source areas and also desk studies including Geographical Information System (GIS) applications and statistical assessments were performed. To justify the training data used in logistic regression analyses as representative, a random sampling procedure was applied. By using the results of the logistic regression analysis, the debris source area probability map of the region is produced. However, according to the field experiences of the authors, the produced map yielded over-predicted results. The main source of the over-prediction is structural relation between the bedding planes and slope aspects on the basis of the field observations, for the generation of debris, the dip of the bedding planes must be taken into consideration regarding the slope face. In order to eliminate this problem, in this study, an approach has been developed using probability distribution of the aspect values. With the application of structural adjustment, the final adjusted debris source area probability map is obtained for the study area. The field observations revealed that the actual debris source areas in the field coincide with the areas having high probability values on this final map.},

  abstract = {The Cappadocia region is one of the most important tourism centers of Turkey owing to its natural beauty and historical heritage. The natural landscapes predominantly contribute to the tourism capacity of the region. This is controlled directly by the characteristic lithological units and surface processes. However, rockfall events, which are sometimes observed in the region, are typical natural hazards conditioned by discontinuities, steep topography and human activities. The Ortahisar Castle is one of the natural monuments and also one of the historical places of this region. This castle is located on a steep hill formed by jointed ignimbrite and its height and settlement area are approximately 50m and 500m2, respectively. However, some blocks on the castle have begun to exhibit serious rockfall potential. Rock hewn structures carved by man for various purposes contribute to increase in rockfall hazard. For this reason, the castle was closed to touristic visits. The purpose of this study was to evaluate this hazard potential and perform a series of rockfall analyses and discuss the results. Besides, location and dimension of fallen blocks were determined. At the final stage of the fieldwork, location and size of detached blocks having potential to fall were described. During the analysis stage, runout distance, bounce height, kinetic energy and velocity of the detached blocks were determined by using Rocfall V.4 software. The results obtained from rockfall analyses were used to map the areas under rockfall threat in the close vicinity of the castle and the potential risk was interpreted.},

  abstract = {The term landslide defines the ``movement of a mass of rock, debris, or earth down a slope.'' However, landslides are not limited either to the ``land'' or to ``sliding.'' Landslides are natural phenomena that cause societal disruptions when humans place parts of the built environment in their path. Slope instability along transportation routes and in mountain valleys poses dangers and is a source of considerable economic losses. Landslide velocities vary over ten orders of magnitude from extremely slow (a few mm/year) to extremely rapid (more than 5 m/s). Large numbers of fatalities can be expected from very rapid and extremely rapid landslides which move faster than a person can run. In contrast, buildings on ``very slow'' and ``extremely slow'' landslides may remain in use for hundreds of years with only minimal damage and repair costs. The volume of individual landslides similarly ranges over many orders of magnitude. The product of landslide volume and speed approximates its ``power'' (or energy). It is a useful measure of the destructive potential of landslides. Landslides are local events; even the largest and most spectacular landslides exist under the radar and rarely result in national disaster declarations. Landslide losses include direct and indirect costs. Direct costs are damages directly attributable to the landslide. Indirect costs include travel detours, economic restrictions, and environmental impacts. Indirect costs often equal or exceed the direct costs. Activities that prevent or reduce the adverse effects of landslides are termed mitigation. Mitigation includes structural and geotechnical measures, as well as political, legal, and administrative measures to protect endangered populations. Reducing the global impact of landslides on risk-prone populations and critical infrastructure is an economic, social, and environmental necessity. Loss data show that, while losses are increasing everywhere, the consequences are much higher in developing countries than in developed countries.},

  abstract = {Wildland fires are common in the western USA. We collected burned and unburned soils from an oak woodland and four mixed conifer sites to determine the effect of fire on soil color and texture. Time since burning ranged from 22 d to 3 yr. Soil color and texture were most noticeably altered in severely burned soil under concentrated fuel (1\textendash 2\% of the land surface), compared with nearby slightly or moderately burned areas. After severe burning, a 1- to 8-cm-thick reddened layer formed at all of the sites, which was redder in hue and had higher chromas and values than the unburned soils. Underlying this layer was a blackened layer with a thickness of 1 to 15 cm and lower Munsell values. Redder hues in the burned soils were apparently the result of Fe oxide transformations and higher values the result of the nearly complete removal of organic matter. Organic C content was also significantly reduced in the blackened layers, so the lower Munsell values were probably due to the charring of the organic matter that remained. The reddened soil layers had significantly less clay than either the unburned soils or blackened layers, which had clay contents that were not significantly different from each other. Sand-sized aggregates formed in the surface soils during burning at four of the five sites, altering the particle-size distribution and resulting in coarser textures due to a greater proportion of sand. Burning produced a finer texture at one site due to an increase in the silt fraction, resulting from the decomposition of kaolinized sand grains. Poorly crystalline aluminosilicates, extracted with boiling 0.5 M KOH, increased in the reddened layer at three of the sites and may contribute to the cementation of the sand-sized aggregates.},

  abstract = {A landslide inventory is the most important information source for quantitative zoning of landslide susceptibility, hazard and risk. It should give insight into the location, date, type, size, activity and causal factors of landslides as well as resultant damage. In Europe, many countries have created or are creating national and/or regional landslide databases (LDBs). Yet little is known on their contents, completeness, format, structure, language use and accessibility, and hence on their ability to perform national or transnational landslide zoning. Therefore, this study presents a detailed analysis of existing national LDBs in the EU member states, EU official candidate and potential candidate countries, and EFTA countries, and their possible use for landslide zoning. These national LDBs were compared with a subset of 22 regional databases. Twenty-two out of 37 contacted European countries currently have national LDBs, and six other countries have only regional LDBs. In total, the national LDBs contain 633,696 landslides, of which 485,004 are located in Italy, while Austria, the Czech Republic, France, Norway, Poland, Slovakia, and the UK also have {$>$}10,000 landslides in their LDBs. National LDBs are generally created in the official language of each country and 58\% of them contain other natural hazards (e.g. floods and sinkholes). About 68\% of the LDBs contain less than 50\% of all landslides in each country, but a positive observation is that 60\% of the LDBs are updated at least once a year or after a major event. Most landslide locations are collected with traditional methods such as field surveys, aerial photo interpretation and analysis of historical records. Currently, integration of landslide information from different national LDBs is hampered because of differences in language and classification systems for landslide type and activity. Other problems are that currently only half of the national LDBs have a direct link between spatial and alphanumeric information, and that public access is generally restricted or limited. A minimum set of features to be included in national LDBs is suggested, and a flow chart is presented that classifies European countries by ability to perform national-scale landslide susceptibility, hazard and risk analyses.},

The literature on landslide risk assessment illustrates the developments which have taken place in the last decade and that quantitative risk assessment is feasible for geotechnical engineering on a site investigation scale and the evaluation of linear features (e.g., pipelines, roads). However, the generation of quantitative risk zonation maps for regulatory and development planning by local authorities still seems a step too far, especially at medium scales (1:10,000\textendash 1:50,000). This paper reviews the problem of attempting to quantify landslide risk over larger areas, discussing a number of difficulties related to the generation of landslide inventory maps including information on date, type and volume of the landslide, the determination of its spatial and temporal probability, the modelling of runout and the assessment of landslide vulnerability. An overview of recent developments in the different approaches to landslide hazard and risk zonation at medium scales is given. The paper concludes with a number of new advances and challenges for the future, such as the use of very detailed topographic data, the generation of event-based landslide inventory maps, the use of these maps in spatial-temporal probabilistic modelling and the use of land use and climatic change scenarios in deterministic modelling.},

ArcGIS version 8.3 was used to manipulate and analyse all the collected data. Probabilistic-likelihood ratio was used to create a landslide susceptibility map for the study area. The result was validated using the Area under Curve (AUC) method and temporal data of landslide occurrences. The validation results showed satisfactory agreement between the susceptibility map and the existing data on landslide locations. As the result, the success rate of the model was (84.46\%) and the prediction rate of the model was (82.38\%) shows high prediction accuracy. In the reclassified final landslide susceptibility zone map, 5.68\% of the total area is classified as critical in nature. The landslide susceptibility map thus produced can be used to reduce hazards associated with landslides and to land cover planning.},

A map of landslide inventory was obtained from the previous work in the Minamata area, the interpretation from aerial photographs taken in 1999 and 2002. A total of 160 landslides was identified in four periods. Following the construction of geospatial databases, including lithology, topography, soil deposits, land use, etc., the study documents the relationship between landslide hazard and the factors that affect the occurrence of landslides. Different methods, namely the logistic regression analysis and the information value model, were then adopted to produce susceptibility maps of landslide occurrence. After the application of each method, two resultant maps categorize the four classes of susceptibility as high, medium, low and very low. Both of them generated acceptable results as both classify the majority of the cells with landslide occurrence in high or medium susceptibility classes, which could be believed to be a success. By combining the hazard maps generated from both methods, the susceptibility was classified as high\textendash medium and low\textendash very low levels, in which the classification of high susceptibility level covers 6.5\% of the area, while the areas predicted to be unstable, which are 50.5\% of the total area, are classified as the low susceptibility level. However, comparing the results from both the approaches, 43\% of the areas were misclassified, either from high\textendash medium to low\textendash very low or low\textendash very low to high\textendash medium classes. Due to the misclassification, 8\% and 3.28\% of all the areas, which should be stable or free of landsliding, were evaluated as high\textendash medium susceptibility using the logistic regression analysis and the information value model, respectively. Moreover, in the case of the class rank change from high\textendash medium susceptibility to low\textendash very low, 35\% and 39.72\% of all mapping areas were predicted as stable using both the approaches, respectively, but in these areas landslides were likely to occur or were actually recognized.},

  abstract = {The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is recognized as a powerful data assimilation technique that generates an ensemble of model variables through stochastic perturbations of forcing data and observations. However, relatively little guidance exists with regard to the proper specification of the magnitude of the perturbation and the ensemble size, posing a significant challenge in optimally implementing the EnKF. This paper presents a robust data assimilation system (RDAS), in which a multi-factorial design of the EnKF experiments is first proposed for hydrologic ensemble predictions. A multi-way analysis of variance is then used to examine potential interactions among factors affecting the EnKF experiments, achieving optimality of the RDAS with maximized performance of hydrologic predictions. The RDAS is applied to the Xiangxi River watershed which is the most representative watershed in China's Three Gorges Reservoir region to demonstrate its validity and applicability. Results reveal that the pairwise interaction between perturbed precipitation and streamflow observations has the most significant impact on the performance of the EnKF system, and their interactions vary dynamically across different settings of the ensemble size and the evapotranspiration perturbation. In addition, the interactions among experimental factors vary greatly in magnitude and direction depending on different statistical metrics for model evaluation including the Nash\textendash Sutcliffe efficiency and the Box\textendash Cox transformed root-mean-square error. It is thus necessary to test various evaluation metrics in order to enhance the robustness of hydrologic prediction systems.},

This disaster was triggered by a landslide. In order to assess the landslide and debris-flow hazard potential of this mountainous region, the study of historic landslides is critical. The objective of the study is to couple 3D slope-stability analysis models and 2D numerical simulation of debris flow within a geographical information systems in order to identity the potential landslide-hazard area. Based on field observations, the failure mechanism of the past landslide is analyzed and the mechanical parameters for 3D slope-stability analysis are calculated from the historic landslide. Then, to locate potential new landslides, the studied area is divided into slope units. Based on 3D slope-stability analysis models and on Monte Carlo simulation, the spots of potential landslides are identified. Finally, we propose a depth-averaged 2D numerical model, in which the debris and water mixture is assumed to be a uniform continuous, incompressible, unsteady Newtonian fluid. The method accurately models the historic debris flow. According to the 2D numerical simulation, the results of the debris-flow model, including the potentially inundated areas, are analyzed, and potentially affected houses, river and road are mapped.},

In this paper, using a newly developed ring shear apparatus, a series of ring-shear tests were conducted on a silty sand to examine the undrained behavior of sand subjected to long shear displacement. Based on the test results, the undrained shear behavior of sands with a wide range of densities is discussed. A very low effective stress corresponding to liquefaction was observed at the steady state in all of the tests on loose, medium, as well as dense sand. The effects of stress state and shear history on the undrained shear behavior were examined by performing tests on a sample with different initial stress states and shearing the same specimen repeatedly (three times) at each initial stress state. The tests at different initial stress states proved that the initial stress state has an influence on static liquefaction resistance but has no eff..., Le comportement en cisaillement non drain\'e des sols durant la progression du d\'eplacement en cisaillement est essentiel pour comprendre ces ruptures de pente par liqu\'efaction avec un long parcours.

  abstract = {This study compares projected changes of precipitation characteristics in the U.S. Northeast in two analogbased climate downscaling products, Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs (MACA) and Localized Constructed Analogs (LOCA). The level of similarity or differences between the two products varies with the type of precipitation metrics. For the total precipitation amount, the two products project significant annual increases that are similar in magnitude, spatial pattern, and seasonal distribution, with the largest increases in winter and spring. For the overall precipitation intensity or temporal aggregation of heavy precipitation (e.g., number of days with more than one inch of precipitation, the simple intensity index, and the fraction of annual precipitation accounted for by heavy events), both products project significant increases across the region with strong model consensus; the magnitude of absolute increases are similar between the two products, but the relative increases are larger in LOCA due to an underestimation of heavy precipitation in LOCA's training data. For precipitation extremes such as the annual maximum 1-day precipitation, both products project significant increases in the long-term mean, but the magnitude of both the absolute and relative changes are much smaller in LOCA than in MACA, indicating that the extreme precipitation differences in the training data are amplified in future projections as a result of the analog-based downscaling algorithms. The two products differ the most in the intensity and frequency of rare extremes (e.g., 1-in-20-years events) for which MACA projects significant increases while the LOCA-projected changes are inconclusive over much of the study area.},

  abstract = {In Japan, landslides triggered by heavy rainfall tend to occur during the annual rainy season from early June until the middle of July; these landslides constitute a major hazard causing significant property damage and loss of life. This paper proposes the use of back propagation neural networks (BPNN) to predict the probability of landslide occurrence for a scenario of heavy rainfall in the Minamata area of southern Kyushu Island, Japan. All of the landslides were detected from aerial photographs taken in 1999, 2001 and 2003, and a geospatial database of lithology, topography, soil characteristics, land use and precipitation was constructed using geographical information systems (GIS). The training sample consists of 602 cells that include landslide activity and 1600 cells in stable areas. Using the trained BPNN with 49 input nodes, three hidden layers, and one output node, 239 589 cells were processed to produce a map of landslide probability for a maximum daily precipitation of 329 mm and a maximum cumulative precipitation of 581 mm for an incessant, intense rainfall event in the future. The resultant hazard map was classified into four hazard levels; it can be referenced for land-use planning and decision-making for community development.

  abstract = {An approach for modelling surface/subsurface flow and transport in a fully integrated way is presented. The diffusive wave approximation used to model runoff is formulated as a nonlinear Darcy law and coupled with the Richards equation for variably saturated flow. The water dynamics in the three physical domains, land surface, vadose zone and saturated zone, is described through a single Richards type equation with domain-dependent parameters. This approach naturally provides pressure and fluxes continuity along land surface. An advective\textendash diffusive transport equation is incorporated in the model in order to follow and identify pre-event and event water. This multi-domain Richards equation is solved with a mixed hybrid finite element formulation. The time discretization is implicit and the nonlinear equations are solved within a sequential iterative Picard scheme. This model can describe both infiltration excess or saturation excess runoff. In order to assess this modelling approach, several classical validation, verification and application test cases are presented. For overland flow solely, the model is compared to an analytical solution and to commonly used hydrological models. The integrated model is then validated with a sandbox laboratory experiment. Finally, the dynamic response of a saturated contributing area at the toe of a 3D virtual hillslope is simulated to illustrate the applicability of the model to 3D situations.},

  abstract = {Rivers are the great shapers of terrestrial landscapes. Very few points on Earth above sea level do not lie within a drainage basin. Even points distant from the nearest channel are likely to be influenced by that channel. Tectonic uplift raises rock thousands of meters above sea level. Precipitation falling on the uplifted terrain concentrates into channels that carry sediment downward to the oceans and influence the steepness of adjacent hill slopes by governing the rate at which the landscape incises. Rivers migrate laterally across lowlands, creating a complex topography of terraces, floodplain wetlands and channels. Subtle differences in elevation, grain size, and soil moisture across this topography control the movement of ground water and the distribution of plants and animals. Rivers in the Landscape, Second Edition, emphasizes general principles and conceptual models, as well as concrete examples of each topic drawn from the extensive literature on river process and form. The book is suitable for use as a course text or a general reference on rivers. Aimed at advanced undergraduate students, graduate students, and professionals looking for a concise summary of physical aspects of rivers, Rivers in the Landscape is designed to:  emphasize the connectivity between rivers and the greater landscape by explicitly considering the interactions between rivers and tectonics, climate, biota, and human activities; provide a concise summary of the current state of knowledge for physical process and form in rivers; reflect the diversity of river environments, from mountainous, headwater channels to large, lowland, floodplain rivers and from the arctic to the tropics; reflect the diverse methods that scientists use to characterize and understand river process and form, including remote sensing, field measurements, physical experiments, and numerical simulations; reflect the increasing emphasis on quantification in fluvial geomorphology and the study of Earth surfaces in general; provide both an introduction to the classic, foundational papers on each topic, and a guide to the latest, particularly insightful and integrative references.},

  abstract = {Form and process in rivers around the world reflect a long history of human influences, but the effects of these influences are often not readily apparent to the casual observer. Progressive alteration of rivers over a period of decades to centuries as a result of land-use patterns influences expectations for the appearance of natural rivers. These expectations in turn help to govern strategies of river restoration, which is being increasingly practiced in industrialized countries. This article uses examples from three regions in the United States \textendash{} headwater streams in the Rocky Mountains, streams in the mid-Atlantic piedmont region of the eastern United States, and coastal rivers of the Puget Lowland in the western United States \textendash{} to explore how historical land-use patterns continue to influence contemporary river form and process, and the implications of these historical effects for understanding and managing rivers. If restoration is designed to facilitate natural river form and process, then it becomes critical to understand how human activities have altered rivers. Such an understanding defines the limits within which restoration can be undertaken and provides a conceptual framework for adaptive management of river restoration.},

  abstract = {This work provides a landslide susceptibility assessment model for rainfall-induced landslides in Central Taiwan based on the analytical hierarchy process method. The model considers rainfall and six site factors, including slope, geology, vegetation, soil moisture, road development and historical landslides. The rainfall factor consists of 10-day antecedent rainfall and total rainfall during a rainfall event. Landslide susceptibility values are calculated for both before and after the beginning of a rainfall event. The 175 landslide cases with detailed field surveys are used to determine a landslide-susceptibility threshold value of 9.0. When a landslide susceptibility assessment value exceeds the threshold value, slope failure is likely to occur. Three zones with different landslide susceptibility levels (below, slightly above, and far above the threshold) are identified. The 9149 landslides caused by Typhoon Toraji in Central Taiwan are utilized to validate the study's result. Approximately, 0.2\%, 0.4\% and 15.3\% of the typhoon-caused landslides are located in the three landslide susceptibility zones, respectively. Three villages with 6.6\%, 0.4\% and 4.9\% of the landslides respectively are used to validate the accuracy of the landslide susceptibility map and analyze the main causes of landslides. The landslide susceptibility assessment model can be used to evaluate susceptibility relative to accumulated rainfall, and is useful as an early warning and landslide monitoring tool.},

The debris covered an area of 1.95km2 and claimed 36 lives. During the sliding, the landslide mass disintegrated with its debris acquiring high speeds to reach over 1km of travel distance. The main objectives of the study were to investigate if it was possible to numerically model the landslide progression, including slope disintegration, and to reproduce the post-failure configuration. Toward these goals, the study employed a discrete element method called discontinuous deformation analysis for the dynamic analysis. By incorporating the spacing and orientation information of the joints and bedding planes, the slope was modeled as an assemblage of discrete deformable blocks. Horizontal and vertical ground motions were simultaneously applied. The near-field digital strong records were affected by the large uplift of the hanging wall of the reverse thrust fault and corrections were made to address this issue. The study showed that the methodology adopted was able to capture essential characteristics of the landslide and gave a post-failure configuration resembling that observed in the field.},

Post-failure behavior and affected area of the lower part of the landslide must be investigated to provide adequate countermeasures. This study presents the results of the post-failure behavior simulation of the lower slope of the Chiu-fen-erh-shan landslide using Discontinuous Deformation Analysis (DDA). The simulation results show that the surface rocks in the sliding mass move faster and further than the rocks at great depth. The angle of internal friction is found to have a great influence on the failure process than does the cohesion. The sliding rocks are accumulated in the depression in front of the toe of the landslide except under the conditions of very low internal friction. The depression performs as a buffer zone when the lower slope fails.},

This work focuses on monthly and annual components of the water budget over 12 National Weather Service (NWS) River Forecast Centers (RFCs). Monthly gridded FLUX Network (FLUXNET) evapotranspiration (ET) from the Max-Planck Institute (MPI) of Germany, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) total runoff (Q), changes in total water storage (dS/dt, derived as a residual by utilizing MPI ET and USGS Q in the water balance equation), and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) observed total water storage anomaly (TWSA) and change (TWSC) are used as reference data sets. Compared to these ET and Q benchmarks, Mosaic and SAC (Noah and VIC) in the operational NLDAS-2 overestimate (underestimate) mean annual reference ET and underestimate (overestimate) mean annual reference Q. The multimodel ensemble mean (MME) is closer to the mean annual reference ET and Q. An anomaly correlation (AC) analysis shows good AC values for simulated monthly mean Q and dS/dt but significantly smaller AC values for simulated ET. Upgraded versions of the models utilized in the research side of NLDAS-2 yield largely improved performance in the simulation of these mean annual and monthly water component diagnostics. These results demonstrate that the three intertwined efforts of improving (1) the scientific understanding of parameterization of land surface processes, (2) the spatial and temporal extent of systematic validation of land surface processes, and (3) the engineering-oriented aspects such as parameter calibration and optimization are key to substantially improving product quality in various land data assimilation systems.},

In NLDAS, the Noah, Variable Infiltration Capacity, Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting, and Mosaic land surface models (LSMs) are executed over the conterminous U.S. (CONUS) in realtime and retrospective modes. These runs support the drought analysis, monitoring and forecasting activities of the National Integrated Drought Information System, as well as efforts to monitor large-scale floods. NLDAS-2 builds upon the framework of the first phase of NLDAS (NLDAS-1) by increasing the accuracy and consistency of the surface forcing data, upgrading the land surface model code and parameters, and extending the study from a 3-year (1997\textendash 1999) to a 30-year (1979\textendash 2008) time window. As the first of two parts, this paper details the configuration of NLDAS-2, describes the upgrades to the forcing, parameters, and code of the four LSMs, and explores overall model-to-model comparisons of land surface water and energy flux and state variables over the CONUS. Focusing on model output rather than on observations, this study seeks to highlight the similarities and differences between models, and to assess changes in output from that seen in NLDAS-1. The second part of the two-part article focuses on the validation of model-simulated streamflow and evaporation against observations. The results depict a higher level of agreement among the four models over much of the CONUS than was found in the first phase of NLDAS. This is due, in part, to recent improvements in the parameters, code, and forcing of the NLDAS-2 LSMs that were initiated following NLDAS-1. However, large inter-model differences still exist in the northeast, Lake Superior, and western mountainous regions of the CONUS, which are associated with cold season processes. In addition, variations in the representation of sub-surface hydrology in the four LSMs lead to large differences in modeled evaporation and subsurface runoff. These issues are important targets for future research by the land surface modeling community. Finally, improvement from NLDAS-1 to NLDAS-2 is summarized by comparing the streamflow measured from U.S. Geological Survey stream gauges with that simulated by four NLDAS models over 961 small basins.},

First, we used the observed multiple layer monthly and annual mean soil moisture from the Illinois Climate Network to evaluate 20-years (January 1985\textendash December 2004) of model-simulated soil moisture in terms of skill and analysis of error statistics. Second, we utilized 6-years (1 January 1997\textendash 31 December 2002) of daily soil moisture observed from 72 sites over the Oklahoma Mesonet network to assess daily and monthly simulation skill and errors for 3 model soil layers (0\textendash 10cm, 10\textendash 40cm, 40\textendash 100cm). Third, we extended the daily assessment to sites over the continental United States using 8-years (1 January 2002\textendash 31 December 2009) of observations for 121 sites from the Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN). Overall, all models are able to capture wet and dry events and show high skill (in most cases, anomaly correlation is larger than 0.7), but display large biases when compared to in situ observations. These errors may come from model errors (i.e., model structure error, model parameter error), forcing data errors, and in situ soil moisture measurement errors. For example, all models simulate less soil moisture due to lack of modeled irrigation and ground water processes in Illinois, Oklahoma, and the other Midwest states.},

A two-step strategy is used to: 1) reduce the random error found in the individual sources and 2) reduce the bias of the combined analysis. First, the three satellite-based estimates and the model predictions are combined linearly based on a maximum likelihood estimate, in which the weighting coefficients are inversely proportional to the squares of the individual random errors determined by comparison with gauge observations and subjective assumptions. This combined analysis is then blended with an analysis based on gauge observations using a method that presumes that the bias of the gauge-based field is small where sufficient gauges are available and that the gradient of the precipitation field is best represented by the combination of satellite estimates and model predictions elsewhere. The algorithm is applied to produce monthly precipitation analyses for an 18-month period from July 1987 to December 1988. Results showed substantial improvements of the merged analysis relative to the individual sources in describing the global precipitation field. The large-scale spatial patterns, both in the Tropics and the extratropics, are well represented with reasonable amplitudes. Both the random error and the bias have been reduced compared to the individual data sources, and the merged analysis appears to be of reasonable quality everywhere. However, the actual quality of the merged analysis depends strongly on our uncertain and incomplete knowledge of the error structures of the individual data sources.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {The minimum safety factor and the critical slip surface of a slope can be located using various methods of optimization or random search. However these methods have not been adopted to search for the three-dimensional (3D) critical slip surface. This paper proposes a new Monte Carlo random simulation method to identify the 3D critical slip surface, in which assuming the initial slip as the lower part of an ellipsoid, the 3D critical slip surface in the 3D slope stability analysis is located by means of a minimization of the 3D safety factor. Based on a column-based three-dimensional slope stability analysis model, a new geographic information systems (GIS) grid-based 3D deterministic model has been developed to calculate the 3D safety factor. Several practical cases, of known minimum safety factor and its critical slip surface by using a two-dimensional (2D) optimization or random technique, have been extended to 3D slope problems to locate the 3D critical slip surface and to compare with the 2D results. As another 3D case, a multi-strata slope, considering the effect of a fault and the underground water, is used to demonstrate the efficiency and capability of the proposed method. Compared with the 2D result, the resulting 3D critical slip surface has no apparent difference for simple slope geometries, but the associated 3D safety factor is definitely higher.},

  abstract = {The main purpose of this study is to compare the following six GIS-based models for susceptibility mapping of earthquake triggered landslides: bivariate statistics (BS), logistic regression (LR), artificial neural networks (ANN), and three types of support vector machine (SVM) models that use the three different kernel functions linear, polynomial, and radial basis. The models are applied in a tributary watershed of the Fu River, a tributary of the Jialing River, which is part of the area of China affected by the May 12, 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. For this purpose, eleven thematic data layers are used: landslide inventory, slope angle, aspect, elevation, curvature, distance from drainages, topographic wetness index (TWI), distance from main roads, distance from surface rupture, peak ground acceleration (PGA), and lithology. The data layers were specifically constructed for analysis in this study. In the subsequent stage of the study, susceptibility maps were produced using the six models and the same input for each one. The validations of the resulting susceptibility maps were performed and compared by means of two values of area under curve (AUC) that represent the respective success rates and prediction rates. The AUC values obtained from all six results showed that the LR model provides the highest success rate (AUC=80.34) and the highest prediction rate (AUC=80.27). The SVM (radial basis function) model generates the second-highest success rate (AUC=80.302) and the second-highest prediction rate (AUC=80.151), which are close to the value from the LR model. The results using the SVM (linear) model show the lowest AUC values. The AUC values from the SVM (linear) model are only 72.52 (success rates) and 72.533 (prediction rates). Furthermore, the results also show that the radial basis function is the most appropriate kernel function of the three kernel functions applied using the SVM model for susceptibility mapping of earthquake triggered landslides in the study area. The paper also provides a counter-example for the widely held notion that validation performances of the results from application of the models obtained from soft computing techniques (such as ANN and SVM) are higher than those from applications of LR and BA models.},

  abstract = {Skip to Next Section The main purpose of this research is to evaluate the modelling capability and predictive power of a bivariate statistical method for earthquake-triggered landslide susceptibility mapping. A weight index (Wi) model was developed for the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake region in Sichuan Province, China, using a wide range of optical remote sensing data, and carried out on the basis of a geographic information system (GIS) platform. The 2008 Wenchuan earthquake triggered 196007 landslides, with a total area of 1150.43 km2, in an approximately oblong area around the Yingxiu\textendash Beichuan coseismic surface fault-rupture (the Yingxiu\textendash Beichuan fault). The landslides of the study area were mapped using visual interpretation of high-resolution satellite images and aerial photographs, both pre- and post-earthquake, and checked in the field at various locations. As a consequence, a nearly complete inventory of landslides triggered by the Wenchuan earthquake was constructed. Topographic and geological data and earthquake-related information were collected, processed and constructed into a spatial database using GIS and image processing technologies. A total of 10 controlling parameters associated with the earthquake-triggered landslides were selected, including elevation, slope angle, slope aspect, slope curvature, slope position, lithology, seismic intensity, peak ground acceleration (PGA), distance from the Yingxiu\textendash Beichuan fault, and distance along this fault. To assist with the development of the model, the complete dataset of 196007 landslides was randomly partitioned into two subsets; a training dataset, which contains 70\% of the data (137204 landslides, with a total area of 809.96 km2), and a testing dataset accounting for 30\% of the data (58803 landslides, with a total area of 340.47 km2). A landslide susceptibility index map was generated using the training dataset, the 10 impact factors, and the Wi model. In addition, for a conditionally dependent factor analysis, seven other factor-combination cases were also used to construct landslide susceptibility index maps. Finally, these eight landslide susceptibility maps were compared with the training data and testing data to obtain model capability (success rate) and predictive power (predictive rate) information. The validation results show that the success and predictive rates of the Wi modelling exceeded 90\% for the approaches that include the use of seismic factors. The final landslide susceptibility map can be used to identify and delineate unstable susceptibility-prone areas, and help planners to choose favourable locations for development schemes, such as infrastructure, construction and environmental protection schemes. The generic component of this research would allow application in other regions affected by high-intensity earthquakes and unstable terrain covering very large areas.},

In recent years, the method has become increasingly popular. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the mapping power of SVM modeling in earthquake triggered landslide-susceptibility mapping for a section of the Jianjiang River watershed using a Geographic Information System (GIS) software. The river was affected by the Wenchuan earthquake of May 12, 2008. Visual interpretation of colored aerial photographs of 1-m resolution and extensive field surveys provided a detailed landslide inventory map containing 3147 landslides related to the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. Elevation, slope angle, slope aspect, distance from seismogenic faults, distance from drainages, and lithology were used as the controlling parameters. For modeling, three groups of positive and negative training samples were used in concert with four different kernel functions. Positive training samples include the centroids of 500 large landslides, those of all 3147 landslides, and 5000 randomly selected points in landslide polygons. Negative training samples include 500, 3147, and 5000 randomly selected points on slopes that remained stable during the Wenchuan earthquake. The four kernel functions are linear, polynomial, radial basis, and sigmoid. In total, 12 cases of landslide susceptibility were mapped. Comparative analyses of landslide-susceptibility probability and area relation curves show that both the polynomial and radial basis functions suitably classified the input data as either landslide positive or negative though the radial basis function was more successful. The 12 generated landslide-susceptibility maps were compared with known landslide centroid locations and landslide polygons to verify the success rate and predictive accuracy of each model. The 12 results were further validated using area-under-curve analysis. Group 3 with 5000 randomly selected points on the landslide polygons, and 5000 randomly selected points along stable slopes gave the best results with a success rate of 79.20\% and predictive accuracy of 79.13\% under the radial basis function. Of all the results, the sigmoid kernel function was the least skillful when used in concert with the centroid data of all 3147 landslides as positive training samples, and the negative training samples of 3147 randomly selected points in regions of stable slope (success rate=54.95\%; predictive accuracy=61.85\%). This paper also provides suggestions and reference data for selecting appropriate training samples and kernel function types for earthquake triggered landslide-susceptibility mapping using SVM modeling. Predictive landslide-susceptibility maps could be useful in hazard mitigation by helping planners understand the probability of landslides in different regions.},

  abstract = {The May 12, 2008 Wenchuan earthquake of China (Mw 7.9 or Ms 8.0) triggered hundreds of thousands of landslides. Mapping such a large number of landslides is a major task, considering the large size of the affected area and the availability of pre- and post-earthquake remote sensing images. This paper compares three (nearly) complete landslide inventories that were compiled from visual image interpretation. The three inventories differ in the manner in which the landslides are represented, either as polygons, centroid points, or top points. Landslides in the three inventories use one-to-one correspondence. Each of the three inventories includes a large proportion of the 197,481 landslides triggered by the earthquake. These landslides were delineated as individual solid polygons and points using visual interpretation of high-resolution aerial photographs and satellite images acquired following the earthquake and verified by selected field checking throughout a broad area of approximately 110,000 km2. These landslides cover a total area of approximately 1,160 km2. Based on the inventories of landslide polygons and landslide centroid points, two types of density maps were constructed. Correlations of landslide occurrence with seismic, geologic, and topographic parameters were analyzed using the three landslide inventories. Statistical analysis of their spatial distribution was performed using both the landslide area percentage (LAP), defined as the percentage of the area affected by the landslides and the landslide number density (LND), defined as the number of landslides per square kilometer. There are two types of LNDs: the LND-centroid (based on the centroid point of the landslide) and the LND-top (based on the top point of the landslide). We used the three indexes to determine how the occurrence of the landslides correlates with elevation, slope angle, slope aspect, slope position, slope curvature, lithology, distance from the epicenter, seismic intensity, distance from the Yingxiu-Beichuan surface fault rupture, peak ground acceleration (PGA), and coseismic surface displacements (including horizontal, vertical, and total displacements). Both the LAP and the two types of LND values were observed to have continuous positive or negative correlations with the slope angle, slope curvature, distance from the epicenter and from the Yingxiu-Beichuan surface fault rupture, seismic intensity, and coseismic surface displacement. In addition, the highest values of the LAP and LND values appear at ranges from 1,200 to 3,000 m in elevation. Moreover, the landslides have preferred orientations, dominated by the eastern, southeastern, and southern directions. In addition, the sandstone, siltstone (Z), and granitic rocks experienced more concentrated landslides. No obvious correlations were observed between the LAP and LND values and slope position. Finally, we studied the orders of eight earthquake-triggered landslide impact factor effect on landslide occurrence.Highlights The 197,481 landslides triggered by the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake were delineated. Three landslide inventories were constructed: polygon, centroid, and top point inventories. The landslides were spatially analyzed with topographic, lithology, and seismic parameters.},

The data quality is a very important issue in landslide studies, and more accurate results will be achieved if the data is adequate, appropriate and drawn from a wide range of parameters. The aim of this study was to evaluate the susceptibility of the occurrence of landslides in Trabzon province, situated in north east Turkey. This was achieved using the following five methods the frequency ratio model, AHP, the statistical index (Wi), weighting factor (Wf) methods, and the logistics regression model, incorporating a Geographical Information System (GIS) and remote sensing techniques. In Trabzon province there has been an increasing occurrence of landslides triggered by rainfall. These landslides have resulted in death, significant injury, damage to property and local infrastructure and threat of further landslides continues. In order to reduce the effects of this phenomenon, it is necessary to scientifically assess the area susceptible to landslide. To achieve this, landslide susceptible areas were mapped the landslide occurrence parameters were analyzed using five different methods. The results of the five analyses were confirmed using the landslide activity map containing 50 active landslide zones. Then the methods giving more accurate results were determined. The validation process showed that the Wf method is better in prediction than the frequency ratio model, AHP, the statistical index (Wi), and logistics regression model.},

They were as much as 400 mm in 24 h, bringing about serious flooding by breaking the river banks. The heavy rainfalls also triggered more than 3,500 landslides. Three months later, the southern region of Mid-Niigata was attacked by an earthquake of magnitude 6.8 on the Richter scale on October 23, 2004. The main earthquakes were followed by intensive aftershocks, which continued until December 2004. By these earthquakes, variable landslides of more than 4,400 also occurred in the hilly and mountainous areas. Namely, different triggers brought about the variable landslides in the hilly mountains whose features are very similar in geological and geomorphological points of view. Therefore, these two events are very useful for clearing the difference in features of the landslides between the two. We have been researching on both landslides in the field just after both occurred and later analyzing air photographs using the geographic information system (GIS). In this paper, we describe the comparison in the distribution features using GIS analytical data between the heavy rainfall-induced and the intensive earthquake-induced landslides.},

A set of automatic water-level probes is deployed to record the highly transient stage, and the post-flooding channel bed elevation is measured. New experimental data resources are provided for understanding the processes of landslide-induced flooding and for testing mathematical rivers models.},

  abstract = {The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is an increasingly popular learning procedure based on statistical learning theory, and involves a training phase in which the model is trained by a training dataset of associated input and target output values. The trained model is then used to evaluate a separate set of testing data. There are two main ideas underlying the SVM for discriminant-type problems. The first is an optimum linear separating hyperplane that separates the data patterns. The second is the use of kernel functions to convert the original non-linear data patterns into the format that is linearly separable in a high-dimensional feature space. In this paper, an overview of the SVM, both one-class and two-class SVM methods, is first presented followed by its use in landslide susceptibility mapping. A study area was selected from the natural terrain of Hong Kong, and slope angle, slope aspect, elevation, profile curvature of slope, lithology, vegetation cover and topographic wetness index (TWI) were used as environmental parameters which influence the occurrence of landslides. One-class and two-class SVM models were trained and then used to map landslide susceptibility respectively. The resulting susceptibility maps obtained by the methods were compared to that obtained by the logistic regression (LR) method. It is concluded that two-class SVM possesses better prediction efficiency than logistic regression and one-class SVM. However, one-class SVM, which only requires failed cases, has an advantage over the other two methods as only ``failed'' case information is usually available in landslide susceptibility mapping.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study is to compare the landslide susceptibility mapping methods of frequency ratio (FR), logistic regression and artificial neural networks (ANN) applied in the Kat County (Tokat\textemdash Turkey). Digital elevation model (DEM) was first constructed using GIS software. Landslide-related factors such as geology, faults, drainage system, topographical elevation, slope angle, slope aspect, topographic wetness index (TWI) and stream power index (SPI) were used in the landslide susceptibility analyses. Landslide susceptibility maps were produced from the frequency ratio, logistic regression and neural networks models, and they were then compared by means of their validations. The higher accuracies of the susceptibility maps for all three models were obtained from the comparison of the landslide susceptibility maps with the known landslide locations. However, respective area under curve (AUC) values of 0.826, 0.842 and 0.852 for frequency ratio, logistic regression and artificial neural networks showed that the map obtained from ANN model is more accurate than the other models, accuracies of all models can be evaluated relatively similar. The results obtained in this study also showed that the frequency ratio model can be used as a simple tool in assessment of landslide susceptibility when a sufficient number of data were obtained. Input process, calculations and output process are very simple and can be readily understood in the frequency ratio model, however logistic regression and neural networks require the conversion of data to ASCII or other formats. Moreover, it is also very hard to process the large amount of data in the statistical package.},

  abstract = {The severe Typhoon Nari ended on September 15, 2001 with a high-intensity and high-accumulation storm that dumped up to 1249 mm of rain in Taipei City, Taiwan. The high-intensity and high-accumulation event caused flooding and triggered more than 400 soils slips and debris flows and large, complex landslides. Detailed information on 63 events, including rainfall, initiation time, and magnitude of landslides were documented and analyzed to identify the landslides and rainfall characteristic in Taipei City during Typhoon Nari. The result reveals that slump, slide, and debris flow events are associated with the situation of highintensity or high-accumulation rainfall. The rainfall intensity-duration condition resulted in smaller magnitude and shallow failures. Medium to massive landslide were mainly related to the high-accumulation rainfall. A landslide regionalization process based on rainfall, geomorphologic and geologic characteristics is proposed. Results of the proposed process show good agreement with landslide events observed in the Taipei City during Typhoon Nari.},

  abstract = {Landslide susceptibility and hazard assessments are the most important steps in landslide risk mapping. The main objective of this study was to investigate and compare the results of two artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms, i.e., multilayer perceptron (MLP) and radial basic function (RBF) for spatial prediction of landslide susceptibility in Vaz Watershed, Iran. At first, landslide locations were identified by aerial photographs and field surveys, and a total of 136 landside locations were constructed from various sources. Then the landslide inventory map was randomly split into a training dataset 70 \% (95 landslide locations) for training the ANN model and the remaining 30 \% (41 landslides locations) was used for validation purpose. Nine landslide conditioning factors such as slope, slope aspect, altitude, land use, lithology, distance from rivers, distance from roads, distance from faults, and rainfall were constructed in geographical information system. In this study, both MLP and RBF algorithms were used in artificial neural network model. The results showed that MLP with Broyden\textendash Fletcher\textendash Goldfarb\textendash Shanno learning algorithm is more efficient than RBF in landslide susceptibility mapping for the study area. Finally the landslide susceptibility maps were validated using the validation data (i.e., 30 \% landslide location data that was not used during the model construction) using area under the curve (AUC) method. The success rate curve showed that the area under the curve for RBF and MLP was 0.9085 (90.85 \%) and 0.9193 (91.93 \%) accuracy, respectively. Similarly, the validation result showed that the area under the curve for MLP and RBF models were 0.881 (88.1 \%) and 0.8724 (87.24 \%), respectively. The results of this study showed that landslide susceptibility mapping in the Vaz Watershed of Iran using the ANN approach is viable and can be used for land use planning.},

The landslide originated from a valley side slope of the loess `yuan' (dissected loess plateau), below which many houses are densely located. The displaced materials smashed several houses and killed 12 persons, after traveling down a long but gentle valley channel. Field surveys revealed that the displaced materials were highly fluidized. Because there was no rainfall before this event, the leakage of irrigation water from the canal on the top of the slope may be the reason for the initiation. To investigate the possible mechanisms underlying the initiation and movement of this landslide, laboratory tests on the loess samples from the source area were performed. Some preliminary research results are presented in this report.},

  abstract = {Evaporation from open surface water is a critical and continuous process in the water cycle. Globally, evaporation losses from reservoirs are estimated to be greater than the combined consumption from industrial and domestic water uses. However, this large volume of water loss is only coarsely considered in modern water resources management practices due to the complexities involved with quantifying these losses. By fusing remote sensing and modeling approaches, this study developed a novel method to accurately estimate the evaporation losses from 721 reservoirs in the contiguous United States (CONUS). Reservoir surface areas were extracted and enhanced from the Landsat based Global Surface Water Dataset (GSWD) from March 1984 to October 2015. The evaporation rate was modeled using the Penman Equation in which the lake heat storage term was considered. Validation results using in situ observations suggest that this approach can significantly improve the accuracy of the simulated monthly reservoir evaporation rate. The evaporation losses were subsequently estimated as the product of the surface area and evaporation rate. This paper presents a first of its kind, comprehensively validated, locally practical, and continentally consistent reservoir evaporation dataset. The results suggest that the long term averaged annual evaporation volume from these 721 reservoirs is 33.73 x 10(9) m(3), which is equivalent to 93\% of the annual public water supply of the United States (in 2010). An increasing trend of the evaporation rate (0.0076 mm/d/year) and a slightly decreasing trend of the total surface area (-0.011 x 10(9) m(2)/year) were both detected during the study period. As a result, the total evaporation shows an insignificant trend, yet with significant spatial heterogeneity. This new reservoir evaporation dataset can help facilitate more efficient water management practices.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a statistical approach to study the spatial relationship between landslides and their causative factors at the regional level. The approach is based on digital databases, and incorporates such methods as statistics, spatial pattern analysis, and interactive mapping. Firstly, the authors propose an object-oriented conceptual model for describing a landslide event, and a combined database of landslides and environmental factors is constructed by integrating the various databases within such a conceptual framework. The statistical histogram, spatial overlay, and dynamic mapping methods are linked together to interactively evaluate the spatial pattern of the relationship between landslides and their causative factors. A case study of an extreme event in 1993 on Lantau Island indicates that rainfall intensity and the migration of the center of the rainstorm greatly influence the occurrence of landslides on Lantau Island. A regional difference in the relationship between landslides and topography is identified. Most of the landslides in the middle and western parts of the island occurred on slopes with slope angles of 25\textendash 35\textdegree, while in the eastern part, the corresponding range is 30\textendash 35\textdegree. Overlaying landslide data with land cover reveals that a large number of landslides occurred in the bareland and shrub-covered area, and in the transition zones between different vegetation types. The proposed approach can be used not only to analyze the general characteristics of such a relationship, but also to depict its spatial distribution and variation, thereby providing a sound basis for regional landslide prediction.},

  abstract = {Landslide susceptibility map is one of the study fields portraying the spatial distribution of future slope failure susceptibility. This paper deals with past methods for producing landslide susceptibility map and divides these methods into 3 types. The logistic linear regression approach is further elaborated on by crosstabs methods, which is used to analyze the relationship between the categorical or binary response variable and one or more continuous or categorical or binary explanatory variables derived from samples. It is an objective assignment of coefficients serving as weights of various factors under considerations while expert opinions make great difference in heuristic approaches. Different from deterministic approach, it is very applicable to regional scale. In this study, double logistic regression is applied in the study area. The entire study area is first analyzed. The logistic regression equation showed that elevation, proximity to road, river and residential area are main factors triggering landslide occurrence in this area. The prediction accuracy of the first landslide susceptibility map was showed to be 80\%. Along the road and residential area, almost all areas are in high landslide susceptibility zone. Some non-landslide areas are incorrectly divided into high and medium landslide susceptibility zone. In order to improve the status, a second logistic regression was done in high landslide susceptibility zone using landslide cells and non-landslide sample cells in this area. In the second logistic regression analysis, only engineering and geological conditions are important in these areas and are entered in the new logistic regression equation indicating that only areas with unstable engineering and geological conditions are prone to landslide during large scale engineering activity. Taking these two logistic regression results into account yields a new landslide susceptibility map. Double logistic regression analysis improved the non-landslide prediction accuracy. During calculation of parameters for logistic regression, landslide density is used to transform nominal variable to numeric variable and this avoids the creation of an excessively high number of dummy variables.},
